## The Sablewood

The Sablewood is a vast, seemingly endless forest, its ancient, dark trees stretching hundreds of feet into the sky. Some locals claim these trees have stood since the time before the Forgotten Gods. The forest is renowned not just for its towering arboreal giants, but also for its unique variety of hybrid animals, such as lemur-toads, tiger-elks, cat-squirrels, and the infamous eeligator. 

These creatures range from benign to deadly:  
- **Cat-squirrels** might gently feed from your hand,  
- while an **eeligator** can suddenly burst from a riverbank, eager to snatch a careless traveler.

Interwoven throughout the forest are well-worn trade routes, traveled by merchants and wanderers alike.

---

### Hush: The Village Within the Woods

Nestled deep in the Sablewood is the small, welcoming village of **Hush**, which serves as the primary destination for the player character during this adventure.

- Many of Hush's people—and others who dwell in the Sablewood—still worship the enigmatic **Forgotten Gods**, though these deities are now nameless.

---

### The Whitefire Arcanist

The spiritual and magical anchor of Hush is the **Whitefire Arcanist**, leader of the village’s primary religious order. The Arcanist is responsible for maintaining the powerful wards that safeguard Hush from the Sablewood’s dangers.

---

This mystical, ancient woodland and its peculiar, tight-knit village set the scene for the adventure to come.



## Narrative Overview

### Act One: The Merchant Cart

On your way to Hush, you encounter an overturned merchant cart blocking your path. A strixwolf—a fearsome creature with the body of a wolf and the face of an owl—is feeding on the driver's corpse.

---

### Act Two: Thicket Thieves

After recovering from the initial shock, you are ambushed by Thistlefolk. These small, bramble-dwelling folk attempt to steal the carriage that holds your important delivery.

---

### Act Three: Seeking an Arcanist

Once you arrive safely in Hush, your next challenge is to seek out the elusive Whitefire Arcanist. To find her, you must talk to the local townspeople and piece together clues about her whereabouts.

---

### Act Four: The Treehouse

Upon opening your mysterious crate, you discover that the package is actually the keystone from the capital city gate's main archway. King Emeris has sent it to the Arcanist so that she may repair the ward which protects the city. The Arcanist enlists your help to ward off danger while she works to complete the ritual needed to restore its magic.

---

### Act Five: The Ward Renewal

You, along with the Whitefire Arcanist, transport the keystone to the ritual site. While the Arcanist performs her magic, magical creatures begin to invade, and you must fight them off until the ritual is complete.

---

## About the Thistlefolk

The Thistlefolk make their homes where few dare tread: deep within the thickest, most tangled brambles of the Sablewood. Although the only Thistlefolk that most travelers ever see are those who venture out to steal goods from passing merchants, this has given them an undeserved reputation as criminals or a thieves’ syndicate.

In reality, most Thistlefolk are gentle and vulnerable creatures who remain within the safety of the brambles to protect themselves from the larger predators that stalk the Sablewood in search of easy meals.

---


## Act One: The Merchant Cart – The Beginning

### Scene Introduction

**Read aloud to your player:**

> _This evening, you finally made it to the Sablewood—a sprawling forest filled with colossal trees some say are even older than the Forgotten Gods. Sablewood is renowned for two things: its sunken trade routes, traveled by countless merchants, and its unique, hybrid animals. Even now, from within your carriage, strange sounds drift in: the low calls of lark-moths, the croak of lemur-toads, the scittering of a family of fox-bats in the underbrush._

**Prompt to Player:**  
_You are driving the carriage._

Ask the player:

> _You’ve noticed something unique about the look of the trees here in the Sablewood. What is it?_

**GM Note:**  
Describe the trees as you pass, specifically incorporating the answer given by the player. (This utilizes the Daggerheart GM Principle: _Ask Questions and Incorporate the Answers._)

---

### The Overturned Cart

**Read aloud:**

> _As your steeds pull the carriage around a tight corner—one wheel briefly leaving the ground—you spot an overturned merchant’s cart, lying sideways in the path and blocking your way forward. A scattering of fruits and vegetables litter the trail._
>
> _From around the side of the cart steps a strixwolf: a large creature with a wolf’s body, an owl’s face, and broad wings arching from its back. It finishes chewing its meal—the hand of a dead merchant—and fixes you with a curious gaze, clearly trying to judge whether you’re friend or foe. Clumsily, two small pups follow, watching their mother and you with caution._
>
> _Inside your own carriage, you feel your vehicle come to a halt._

**Ask:**  
_What would you like to do?_

Give the player a chance to roleplay and act. When you approach the merchant cart, proceed to the action roll.

---

### The First Action Roll

**Read aloud:**

> _The strixwolf is wary of your movement. Let’s make our first roll to see how she reacts! This uses your **Presence** trait, so grab your Duality Dice and roll them, then add your Presence. If you wish, spend a Hope before the roll to add an Experience, if it applies. Then tell me your total, and which die came out higher!_

#### Roll Results

---

**Success (10 or higher):**  
- The strixwolf tries to keep her pups safe and remains calm.
- If rolled with *Hope*: Tell the player to gain a Hope.
- If rolled with *Fear*: Gain a Fear.
- Introduce a consequence to keep the tension—move the narrative forward without undermining success.  

  _Sample narration_:  
  > _The mother strixwolf hoot-howls, perhaps calling another strixwolf from the trees. You sense you might not be alone for long._

---

**Failure (9 or below):**  
- The strixwolf snarls and snaps at the approaching PC, upset by your presence.
- If rolled with *Hope*: The player still gains a Hope. As GM, introduce a complication, but soften it compared to a full failure.

  _Sample narration_:  
  > _With a final snarl, she leans down to let her pups clamber onto her back, then takes off into the air, landing on a branch where she continues to watch your every move._

- If rolled with *Fear*: Gain a Fear. The strixwolf’s aggression causes the PC to mark a Stress.

---

**Critical Success (both dice the same number):**
- Tell the player to mark a Hope. If you have any Stress, you may clear one.
- The strixwolf approaches, head low and tail wagging, then sits calmly before the PC, showing cautious trust.

---

**GM Guidance:**  
Let the player interpret and interact with these outcomes. Be sure to incorporate specific consequences or opportunities that flow naturally from your choices and the results of the first action roll.

---


## Thicket Thieves: Act Two, Part One — The Fallout

Let the events of the previous act play out naturally, allowing the player to roleplay and take other actions. Use the following scenarios as guidance:

---

### SCENARIOS

- **Searching the Merchant Cart**  
  If the player decides to search the merchant cart, describe how it has been completely stripped of all valuables. The dead driver can be found with a mangled arm, clearly picked over by the strixwolf family for food.

- **Inspecting the Body Further**  
  If you choose to examine the body more closely, you may discover that the driver's neck was slit.

- **Attacking the Strixwolf**  
  If you attack the strixwolf, make an attack roll against a difficulty of 10. On a success, you deal damage using your weapon, and the pups will flee.

- **Failed Interactions with the Strixwolf**  
  If you fail any rolls to interact with the strixwolf, it pulls its pups onto its back and flies into a nearby tree, watching you from above.

- **Searching for Clues**  
  If you look for signs of something unusual, you spot the remnants of thorny bramble tangled around the carriage wheel and scattered along the road.

- **Trying to Move On**  
  If you attempt to move the merchant cart out of the way, try to get your own carriage moving again, or try to leave the trail, proceed to [Ambushed!](#the-ambush).

---

#### Strixwolf Mother *(Stat Block)*

| **Major Threshold:** 4 | **Severe Threshold:** 8 |

---

## The Ambush

When the moment feels right, or if one of the above scenarios triggers it, ask the player to make an **Instinct Roll** with a difficulty of 14.

- **On a Success:**  
  You notice eyes watching you from the darkness beyond the trail.  
  - If the roll was with *Fear*: Gain a Fear and have the player mark a Stress.  
  - Use the [See Them Coming](#see-them-coming) prompts below.

- **On a Failure:**  
  You are immediately ambushed.  
  - If the roll was with *Fear*: Gain a Fear and have the player also mark a Stress.  
  - Use the [Ambushed!](#ambushed) prompts below.

---

### See Them Coming

**Read aloud:**

> "You hear the sound of a branch snapping and turn to see four Thistlefolk sneaking through the underbrush, attempting to get the jump on you. The overturned cart was a distraction, but their plan didn't work. I'm going to set up a map!"

---

### Ambushed!

**Read aloud:**

> "In a whirlwind of cracking branches and unsheathed blades, a group of four Thistlefolk leap from the brush alongside the road. The overturned cart was an ambush! They stand before you, weapons drawn, blocking the road. They'll go first. I’m going to set up a battle map!"

---

## Setting Up the Battle Map

- Take the forest terrain you've prepared and ask the player to help spread it across the table to build the encounter map.
- Encourage the player to add items from around the room to enrich the terrain, building the playspace together.
- Place the overturned merchant cart on the table. Ask the player to place their miniature nearby, along with their carriage, where you imagine yourself to be in the scene.
- Finally, place the Thistlefolk Ambusher and Thistlefolk Thief standees in **Close** range of the player.

---

## Beginning the Encounter

On the following page, you'll find the stat blocks for the Ambushers and Thief. Use them to guide the remainder of this encounter.

**GM Tips:**
- Make the battle your own! Decide in detail what the Thistlefolk look like, and describe the scene vividly, as if it's unfolding in a movie or story.
- Invite your player to participate in creating the scene:  
  - Ask them to describe their attacks or evasive maneuvers in detail.  
  - Prompt them for unique visual elements: What distinctive clothing do the Ambushers wear? What is unique about their fighting style?
  - Discuss with your player what level of violence you're comfortable with. Are you aiming to kill the Thistlefolk, incapacitate, or knock them out?

---


## Act Two: Thicket Thieves – Part Two – The First Encounter

### Ambushed!

If the player was ambushed, the Thistlefolk act first. This is reflected in the Thistlefolk Ambusher's feature, **Ambush**.

**Read Aloud:**

> "Having the upper hand, the three Thistlefolk Ambushers rush you! Because of their Ambush feature, they get to make an attack immediately. This only happens when they enter the scene, so it won’t be like this every time. But right now, they are slashing at you with daggers, protected by armor made of polished stones."

- Move the Ambushers into melee with the player character.
- Then, follow the attack guide (below) for each Ambusher.

---

### See Them Coming

If the player spotted the Ambushers before the attack, you get to act first.

**Read Aloud:**

> "You stand at the ready, having spotted the Thistlefolk before they could ambush you! You get to act first."

---

### Thistlefolk Tactics and Goals

- **Goal:** Use the Ambushers to keep the player's attention while the Thief attempts to steal your carriage.

---

### Using Reference Stat Blocks

- On the Thistlefolk Ambusher, you'll notice the stat block is listed as "Reference" with three other smaller stat blocks below it.
- This is how Daggerheart represents three adversaries with identical stats. Instead of repeating information, everything is centralized; treat each Ambusher as having the same abilities.

---

### Ambusher Attack Guide

When you make an attack against a PC:
1. Roll a d20 and add the Ambusher's attack modifier (**+1**).
2. Compare this to the PC’s **Evasion**.
    - If the attack hits, roll damage using **1d8+5**.
    - Ask the player to compare the total to your damage thresholds, use armor if you'd like, and mark your hit point(s) accordingly.

---

### Thief Attack Guide

When you make an attack against a PC with the Thistlefolk Thief:
1. Roll a d20 and add the Thief’s attack modifier (**+3**).
2. Compare this to the PC’s **Evasion**.
    - If the attack hits, roll damage using **2d4+3**.
    - Have the player compare the total to your damage thresholds, use armor if you'd like, and mark your hit point(s).
    - If the Thief is using **Back Off**, and the attack succeeds, deal the listed damage and move the player's standee in a direction of your choice—into **Far** range from where you were.

---

### Ambusher/Thief Defense Guide

- When an adversary (Ambusher or Thief) is hit with damage, compare the amount to their thresholds and mark appropriate hit points.
- When the last hit point is marked, that adversary is defeated.

---

---

## Act Three: Seeking an Arcanist

### Arrival in Hush

**Read the following aloud:**

> The path leads you further into the forest until you spot a large stone pillar, carved top to bottom in ancient dwarven symbols. This denotes one corner of the peaceful village of Hush. When you pass beyond the stone marker, you feel a small sensation like the pop of a bubble, then the sounds of friendly chatter become louder. Though the trees of the Sablewood are unchanged here, there is a distinctive safe and comforting air.  
>  
> A few smiling faces turn to you as your carriage rolls in, waving or casting a warm greeting toward you. There is lively music drifting your direction from the tavern at the center of town.  
>
> You know you need to find the Whitefire Arcanist to deliver the package from the King.  
>  
> What would you like to do?

---

### Interacting with the Locals

If the player would like to talk to an NPC, consider introducing one of the following:

**NPC Options**

- **Fidget**  
  _Wildborne Human (they/them)_  
  A young child who will not stop wiggling—it's clear how they earned their name. They are often busy scurrying up the trees in town, lighting lanterns that hang from the branches. Fidget knows the fastest ways through the village. If you approach, they are curious about what life is like outside Hush.

- **Lausa Standworth**  
  _Wildborne Dwarf (she/her)_  
  An older woman with a thick beard, carrying a barrel of ale (which she will keep on her shoulder the entire time). If you approach, she wants to know the name of your weapon and the date it was forged.

- **Halython Fives**  
  _Loreborne Clank (he/him)_  
  A soft-spoken clank (a humanoid robot) of indeterminate age. His metallic shoulder bears scratches where an alert but friendly fox-bat rests. He is playing an unknown game that uses cards and acorns. If you approach, he is curious about the Thistlefolk and asks if you encountered any on your way.

During the conversation, introduce a second NPC from the list above. The second NPC will be a friend who knows where the Whitefire Arcanist lives. They last saw her at the tavern and will send you in that direction.

_Example progression_: You might meet Fidget in town. After some conversation and coaxing, Fidget points you to the tavern to meet Lausa.

---

### The Clover Tavern

**Read the following aloud:**

> The Clover Tavern is a sight to behold, with six curving stories climbing the trunk of an ancient tree. This is the heart of the community, always crowded with music and good-natured conversation.
>
> Newcomers to the bar must take off their shoes and hang them over a line that stretches across the bar’s ground floor. Inevitably, by the time visitors leave, their shoes will be shined and filled with small trinkets.
>
> As you enter, what would you like to do?

Let the player roleplay—introduce a barkeep or friendly local who invites you to participate in the shoe tradition. Encourage you to explore different levels of the tavern.

Consider asking the player to describe details about the tavern, such as:

- How does the second floor differ from the first?
- What smells permeate the air?
- What unique customs do locals perform when anyone enters a room?

---

### Optional: The Firstmoss Festival

If the player inquires, you will find out that Hush is currently celebrating the **Firstmoss Festival**—the time when new crops in the Sunless Farms have developed their first layer of moss, signaling the start of ripening for the season.

It’s a celebration of spring’s arrival and the abundance of fresh fruits and vegetables soon to come.

**Festival Activities Might Include:**

- Arm wrestling competition
- Stone-painting class
- A small marketplace of homemade trinkets

---

### Finding the Whitefire Arcanist

When you're ready, guide the player to interact with an NPC who can help you reach the Arcanist. If you skip asking anyone in town, simply use one of the NPCs described above.

After a few exchanges, the NPC can share:

> "The Arcanist is quite busy, but if you’ve traveled so far, I’m sure she’ll be more than hospitable. We would be lost without her. She keeps this whole place protected by a powerful ward so that no dangers from the Sablewood can pass into town.
>
> "You’ll find her house to the south, through the farmland. It’s hanging from one of the old Sablewood trees—you can’t miss it."

When the player is ready, send them off towards the Arcanist's home.

---


---

## ACT FOUR: The Treehouse of the Whitefire Arcanist

### Arrival at the Arcanist's Treehouse

**Read the following aloud:**

> Making your way past the homes of the village and through the farmlands of Hush, you see a variety of crops beginning to sprout a thin layer of glowing blue moss over their fruits and vegetables. The moss pulses softly, like a heartbeat, as you pass.
>
> Among the thriving groves, the Sablewood trees stand tall, each carved with hundreds of unique faces, their eyes peering in every direction. One tree, taller than the rest, holds the Arcanist’s home, dangling like an overripe fruit. The home itself is suspended by a braid of rope as thick as a giant’s forearm, tied to a massive branch and counterweighted by a cabin-sized boulder lying at the tree's base. Symbols mark the stone, and the cabin’s windows flicker with a soft yellow-green light.
>
> What would you like to do?

---

### Exploring and Approaching the Treehouse

Allow the player a moment to roleplay, encouraging problem-solving and creative approaches. You may use or adapt the guidance below:

- **Calling Up:** If the player tries to call to the Arcanist from below, there is no response, but the light inside continues to flicker.
- **Cutting the Rope:** If you attempt to cut the counterweight rope, a burst of magical force blasts you backwards a few feet, causing you to suffer 1 Stress.
- **Climbing the Tree:** If the player attempts to climb, require an **Agility Roll** (Difficulty 13). On a failure, a tree limb gently picks you up, sets you safely on the forest floor, and resumes its original form.

Let the player experiment until they succeed in getting the Arcanist's attention.

---

### Meeting the Whitefire Arcanist

When you finally earn the Arcanist's attention, describe her with the following:

> Emanating from the home comes a seven-foot-tall blend of humanoid and firefly: the Whitefire Arcanist herself. She's a faerie who moves with an uncanny mix of deliberate slowness and sudden, jerky motions. Her facial expressions are subtle, but her voice is full of clear emotion. Though old, she is spry and eyes you mischievously.
>
> "Are you the one Emeris sent from the capital? Oh my, you're rather late, aren't you? Come in, come in."

As she lowers her home and invites you inside, describe the interior:

- The main room is crowded with potion bottles, spellbooks, runes, plants, and a menagerie of small creatures.
- Despite the chaos, not a single thing is out of place; it’s clear that even moving an item an inch would be noticed instantly by the Arcanist.

---

### The Package from King Emeris

Let the player freely roleplay. The Arcanist is curious about:

- Your journey so far
- The NPC who directed you here
- (Playfully) How you imagine you will someday die

Whenever conversation winds down, the Arcanist asks after the package from King Emeris.

> To inspect it safely, she magically unfolds her home like a blossoming flower. She urges you to quickly bring the crate inside before the cabin closes up again, now a shade larger than before.

**Read aloud as she opens the delivery:**

> Inside King Emeris’ package lies a massive stone with a lion’s face carved into it. Marlowe, you recognize it immediately: the keystone from the capital city gate’s main archway.
>
> The Arcanist nods sagely. “Of course the King would keep this delivery secret. If anyone knew your city was no longer warded, you would be conquered before sunrise.”
>
> With a serious tone, she begins to ready her unusual home for travel again. “We must travel to the Open Vale to revitalize the ward. Such an effort of magic will attract dangerous creatures from the dark reaches of the Sablewood. I’ll need your help.”

---

### Transition to Act Five

If the player is eager to assist, proceed directly to **The Open Vale** (Act Five). If they wish, allow them to describe your experiences traveling alongside the eccentric, enigmatic Whitefire Arcanist.

---



## Act Five: The Ward Renewal  
### Part One: The Open Vale

**Read aloud:**  
On the Arcanist’s instructions, your carriage arrives in a mysterious clearing—an almost perfect circle—the only spot in the Sablewood without trees crowding out the sky. This is **The Open Vale**.

> The Arcanist appears thoughtful as she surveys the clearing.  
>  
> "This place," she says, "has always been used for powerful ritual magic. It’s here that I first forged the ward pillars found at the four corners of Hush, the ones that keep your village safe to this day. I nearly died performing that ritual."
>
> She seems ready to share more, but stops herself, perhaps uneasy about offending the Forgotten Gods.

Invite the player to interact and speak with the Arcanist. Let them ask questions and explore her mood or the location. When you are ready to move the story forward, read the following:

The Arcanist’s antennae twitch in a strange, almost startling manner.  
> “This is good. Stop, stop. Yes, here. Now come help me, I’m old.”


She unfolds the carriage (just as she did with her home) and stands over the crate, humming softly. Her body brightens, flickering with light in the night air.

> “I’ll need about an hour to prepare. Please, enjoy the night air while you can—we will be quite busy soon.”

---

### Adversary Reference: Ancient Skeleton

**Ancient Skeleton**  
*Tier 1 Standard*

- **Difficulty:** 12  
- **Thresholds:** 7/none  
- **HP:** 2

    - All those skeletons move to Melee range of the target and make one combined attack roll.  
    - On a success, each deals 4 physical damage (combine total damage as appropriate).

---



## Act Five: The Ward Renewal  
### Part Two: The Ritual Begins

---

### Opening Scene

**Read aloud:**  
The Arcanist lets out a shrill cry:  
> “The keystone has finally responded! Quickly, surround me, the ritual must begin or I’ll lose the pathway! Hurry!”

Her body begins to glow, ever brighter, as her eyes roll back into her head. The entire carriage lifts a foot off the ground. Unnatural screeches echo through the woods as creatures sense the surge of arcane energy.

---

Arrange the scene as follows:
- Place the Whitefire Arcanist standee at the center of the table.
- Have the player place their character standee in the scene.
- Place **four Ancient Skeletons** within *close* range of the Arcanist.
- Place **two Forest Wraiths** within *far* range.

**Read aloud:**  
You feel a tremor as four ancient skeletons claw their way from beneath the earth, rusted swords in hand—disturbed by the magic the Arcanist wields. In the distance, two Forest Wraiths float toward you, silent but menacing.

---

### The Ritual Countdown

To guide the encounter:

- Take a d8 and set it on the table with the **8** facing up.  
- **This is the ritual’s countdown die.**  
    - **Tick down** the die by 1 whenever an adversary is defeated.
    - **Tick up** the die by 1 each time the Whitefire Arcanist is hit by an attack.
- **Goal:** Defend the Arcanist until the countdown reaches **0**. When this happens, the ritual is complete and combat ends.

---

### Environmental Feature: Vengeance of the Vale

#### The Open Vale  
- **Tier:** 1  
- **Type:** Exploration

**Feature: Vengeance of the Vale**  
- *Action*: Spend a Fear to summon two additional Ancient Skeletons from the ground within **very close range** of a PC.

> *Note to GM: Environments can offer unique features. Use this one to add challenge or urgency to the encounter when needed.*

---

### Encounter Guidance for the GM

- The ritual countdown only ticks down when adversaries are defeated.  
    - If progress stalls, use **Vengeance of the Vale** to introduce more skeletons—the player should be able to defeat them easily.
- Have adversaries focus attacks on the Whitefire Arcanist if the player is not within range.
    - Her **Difficulty** is 11.  
    - The Arcanist does **not** track HP or Stress; damage to her is narrative only.
- Keep up pacing and danger, but remember the Arcanist's survival is crucial.

---

    - On a hit, deals **2d6+8 magic damage**.
    - **Resistance:** Physical damage taken is halved (rounded up).
- **Memory Delve:** Makes target **Vulnerable** (*all rolls against them have advantage until their next rest*—this condition does **not** stack).
- **Pass-Through:** Use this power sparingly, as it incapacitates the player. If the player becomes **Untethered**, they can't act until an adversary is defeated (i.e., countdown ticks down).  
    - If the player is Untethered, they mark 2 HP and their soul returns.

*Tip: Use Vengeance of the Vale to create weak skeletons for quick victories if the player becomes Untethered.*

## Beyond the Vale: Epilogue

### The Keystone Ward

#### Read Aloud:

As you deliver a powerful blow, the ritual ends! The carriage crashes to the ground as the keystone vibrates with arcane energy. Then, all at once, a soundless explosion bursts from the Whitefire Arcanist, scattering the last remnants of any enemies. The clearing falls silent.

---

Shortly after, you return inside the cozy treehouse. The keystone now hangs carefully suspended over a rumbling fire in the hearth. The Arcanist, looking even older than before, sits cross-legged in an overstuffed chair. There is a deep exhaustion in her voice as she addresses you:

> “You fought hard. I’m not surprised, of course. The King keeps good company. I’m very glad you were there.”

---

#### Wrapping Up

Give the player space to speak with the Arcanist, resolve personal moments, or ask final questions. When conversation slows or the player inquires about the keystone, continue with:

> “The keystone will need a week, maybe more, to allow the magic to settle. I’ll need to watch it carefully—make sure nothing cracks, or becomes sentient or anything of the like. You know how it is.  
>  
> And in the meantime, after you rest and gather yourselves, have a nice hot meal and warm bath, I have one more thing to ask of you.”

---

#### A Glimpse Beyond

Zoom out from the Arcanist’s home, rising above the forest’s canopy. Stone spires twist through the treeline, each bearing a flickering flame—beacons against the shadows.

The Arcanist continues:

> “There’s a Spire, just west of here, maybe a few hours walk. I sensed its power on the way to the ritual, but it felt… strange. The light was weaker than it should be.  
>  
> I fear something is terribly wrong with the Spirekeeper. And if its fire goes out entirely, I dread what might follow.  
>  
> When you're ready, come back and I'll give you my map so you can make it there safely. It's good to have a hero in the Sablewood again."
