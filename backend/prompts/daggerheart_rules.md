## Duality Dice and Hope & Fear

**Duality Dice:** Roll two d12s (one Hope, one Fear). Add trait modifier. Higher die determines result.

**Advantage:** Roll d6 and add to action roll total. Disadvantage: roll d6 and subtract from total.

**Hope:** When Hope die is higher, mark Hope. PCs start with 2 Hope at character creation, max 6 Hope at one time. Hope carries over between sessions. Spend Hope to:
- **Utilize an Experience:** When you make a relevant action or reaction roll, spend Hope to add an Experience's modifier (+2 typically) to the result. You can spend multiple Hope to utilize multiple Experiences. Experiences are narrative tags reflecting character specializations (e.g., "Royal Mage", "Not Afraid of Anything").
- **Help an Ally:** When an ally is making an action roll, describe how you help and roll an advantage die (d6). The ally adds the result to their final total. Multiple players can help the same ally, but only the highest result is added.
- **Hope Features:** Use class-specific Hope abilities (costs vary)
- **Tag Team Roll:** Spend 3 Hope (once per session). Two PCs combine actions, both roll separately, choose one result to apply to both. Combat: both roll damage, add totals together as single source. On Hope, all involved PCs gain Hope. On Fear, GM gains Fear for each PC involved.

**Fear:** When Fear die is higher, GM gains Fear. GM starts campaign with 1 Fear per PC, max 12 at one time. Fear carries over between sessions. GM gains Fear when: PC rolls with Fear, PCs take a rest, or an ability/effect says so. GM spends Fear to:
- **Interrupt Players:** Spend 1 Fear to seize spotlight and make a move
- **Extra GM Move:** Spend 1 Fear to make an additional GM move
- **Activate Fear Features:** Spend Fear to use adversary's Fear Feature or environment's Fear Feature
- **Enhance Adversary Rolls:** Spend 1 Fear to add adversary's Experience to a roll
- **End Temporary Effect:** Spend 1 Fear to end a temporary effect (like a spell)

## GM Moves

**When to Make a GM Move:** Player rolls with Fear, player fails roll, unavoidable consequences, golden opportunity, players look to GM.

**Soft Moves (Minor):** Introduce obstacle/enemy, ask what happens next, signal off-screen threat, show world reacts, reveal unwelcome truth, shift environment.

**Hard Moves (Major):** Put character in immediate danger, separate party, make PC mark Stress, capture someone/something important, use PC's backstory against them, take away opportunity permanently, show collateral damage.

## Combat

**Action Rolls:** Roll Duality Dice + trait modifier vs Difficulty. Higher die determines Hope/Fear result.

**Attack Rolls:** PCs roll Duality Dice + weapon trait modifier vs target's Difficulty. Adversaries roll d20 + attack modifier vs PC's Evasion.

**Spellcast Rolls:** Roll Duality Dice + Spellcast trait (from subclass) vs target's Difficulty. Works like attack rolls.

**Reaction Rolls:** Roll Duality Dice + trait modifier vs target's Difficulty. Used for reactions like avoiding attacks or hazards. Reaction rolls don't generate Hope or Fear, don't trigger GM moves, and other characters can't help with Help an Ally. Critical success: ignore any effects that would have impacted you on a success.

**Attack Outcomes:**
- **Success with Hope:** PC gains Hope, deal damage normally.
- **Success with Fear:** GM gains Fear, can make GM move (adversary attacks, mark Stress, new threat, raise stakes).
- **Failure with Hope:** PC gains Hope, GM makes minor move.
- **Failure with Fear:** GM gains Fear, GM makes major move (immediate danger, multiple adversaries, separated from party, lost opportunity).

**Damage Thresholds:** Compare damage to thresholds (add level). Minor: mark 1 HP, Major: mark 2 HP, Severe: mark 3 HP.

**Armor:** Mark Armor Slot to reduce damage severity by one threshold (Severe→Major, Major→Minor, Minor→None).

**Ranges:** Melee, Very Close (5-10ft), Close (10-30ft), Far (30-100ft), Very Far (100-300ft).

**Movement:** Move within Close range and take action, or move farther by forgoing action and making Agility roll.

**Stress & HP:** Characters have Stress slots. Many abilities cost Stress. If you must mark Stress but can't, mark HP instead. If you mark your last HP, make a death move (typically fall unconscious until healed or danger passes).

**Tier:** Level 1 = Tier 1, Levels 2-4 = Tier 2, Levels 5-7 = Tier 3, Levels 8-10 = Tier 4. Used for some ability scaling.

**Proficiency:** Number of damage dice rolled equals Proficiency (typically 1 at level 1).

**Weapons:** Have trait (Agility, Strength, etc.), range, damage dice + modifier, and type (physical or magic). One-handed or two-handed. Roll Proficiency dice + modifier for damage.

**Armor:** Provides base damage thresholds (add level) and Armor Score (number of Armor Slots). Features may grant special abilities.

**Conditions:**
- **Vulnerable:** Rolls against them have advantage (roll d6, add to roll)
- **Restrained:** Can't move
- **Hidden/Cloaked:** Unseen, benefits vary by class

## Resources

**Gold:** Start with 1 handful. 10 handfuls = 1 bag (erase all handfuls). 10 bags = 1 chest.

**Domain Cards:** Loadout = active abilities. Vault = stored abilities. During rest, swap cards between Loadout and Vault. Cards in Vault have Recall Cost (Stress cost to swap into Loadout).

## Rest

**Short Rest (1 hour):** Each player can move domain cards between loadout and vault for free, then choose 2 moves (can repeat same move):
- **Tend to Wounds:** Clear 1d4+Tier HP (self or ally)
- **Clear Stress:** Clear 1d4+Tier Stress
- **Repair Armor:** Clear 1d4+Tier Armor Slots (self or ally)
- **Prepare:** Describe how you prepare yourself, then gain 1 Hope (or 2 Hope if with one or more party members)
GM gains 1d4 Fear. Features/effects with limited uses per rest refresh.

**Long Rest (overnight):** Each player can move domain cards between loadout and vault for free, then choose 2 moves (can repeat same move):
- **Tend to All Wounds:** Clear all HP (self or ally)
- **Clear All Stress:** Clear all Stress
- **Repair All Armor:** Clear all Armor Slots (self or ally)
- **Prepare:** Describe how you prepare for the next day's adventure, then gain 1 Hope (or 2 Hope if with one or more party members)
- **Work on a Project:** With GM approval, pursue a long-term project. First time starting a project, assign it a countdown. Each time you make this move, advance the countdown automatically or make an action roll (GM's choice).
GM gains Fear equal to 1d4 + number of PCs, and can advance a long-term countdown. Features/effects with limited uses per rest or per long rest refresh. After 3 short rests in a row, next rest must be long rest.
