## Duality Dice and Hope & Fear

**Duality Dice:** Roll two d12s (one Hope, one Fear). Add trait modifier. Higher die determines result.

**Advantage:** Roll d6 and add to action roll total. Disadvantage: roll d6 and subtract from total.

**Hope:** When Hope die is higher, mark Hope. Spend Hope to:
- **Experience:** Before action roll, add Experience value (+2 typically) as modifier if it applies to the scene. Experiences are narrative tags reflecting character specializations (e.g., "Royal Mage", "Not Afraid of Anything").
- **Help Ally:** Explain how you aid them, roll d6 advantage die they add to their action roll
- **Hope Features:** Use class-specific Hope abilities (costs vary)
- **Tag Team Roll:** Spend 3 Hope (once per session). Two PCs combine actions, both roll separately, choose one result to apply to both. Combat: both roll damage, add totals together as single source.

**Fear:** When Fear die is higher, GM gains Fear. GM starts with 1 Fear per PC, max 12. GM spends Fear to:
- **Interrupt Players:** Spend 1 Fear to seize spotlight and make a move
- **Extra GM Move:** Spend 1 Fear for additional move on GM's turn
- **Activate Fear Features:** Spend Fear to use adversary/environment Fear Features
- **Enhance Adversary Rolls:** Spend 1 Fear to add adversary's Experience modifier to roll

## GM Moves

**When to Make a GM Move:** Player rolls with Fear, player fails roll, unavoidable consequences, golden opportunity, players look to GM.

**Soft Moves (Minor):** Introduce obstacle/enemy, ask what happens next, signal off-screen threat, show world reacts, reveal unwelcome truth, shift environment.

**Hard Moves (Major):** Put character in immediate danger, separate party, make PC mark Stress, capture someone/something important, use PC's backstory against them, take away opportunity permanently, show collateral damage.

## Combat

**Action Rolls:** Roll Duality Dice + trait modifier vs Difficulty. Higher die determines Hope/Fear result.

**Attack Rolls:** PCs roll Duality Dice + weapon trait modifier vs target's Difficulty. Adversaries roll d20 + attack modifier vs PC's Evasion.

**Spellcast Rolls:** Roll Duality Dice + Spellcast trait (from subclass) vs target's Difficulty. Works like attack rolls.

**Reaction Rolls:** Roll Duality Dice + trait modifier vs target's Difficulty. Used for reactions like Attack of Opportunity. Critical success: choose two effects instead of one.

**Attack Outcomes:**
- **Success with Hope:** PC gains Hope, deal damage normally.
- **Success with Fear:** GM gains Fear, can make GM move (adversary attacks, mark Stress, new threat, raise stakes).
- **Failure with Hope:** PC gains Hope, GM makes minor move.
- **Failure with Fear:** GM gains Fear, GM makes major move (immediate danger, multiple adversaries, separated from party, lost opportunity).

**Damage Thresholds:** Compare damage to thresholds (add level). Minor: mark 1 HP, Major: mark 2 HP, Severe: mark 3 HP.

**Armor:** Mark Armor Slot to reduce damage severity by one threshold (Severe→Major, Major→Minor, Minor→None).

**Ranges:** Melee, Very Close (5-10ft), Close (10-30ft), Far (30-100ft), Very Far (100-300ft).

**Movement:** Move within Close range and take action, or move farther by forgoing action and making Agility roll.

**Stress & HP:** Characters have Stress slots. Many abilities cost Stress. If you must mark Stress but can't, mark HP instead. If you mark your last HP, make a death move (typically fall unconscious until healed or danger passes).

**Tier:** Level 1 = Tier 1, Levels 2-4 = Tier 2, Levels 5-7 = Tier 3, Levels 8-10 = Tier 4. Used for some ability scaling.

**Proficiency:** Number of damage dice rolled equals Proficiency (typically 1 at level 1).

**Weapons:** Have trait (Agility, Strength, etc.), range, damage dice + modifier, and type (physical or magic). One-handed or two-handed. Roll Proficiency dice + modifier for damage.

**Armor:** Provides base damage thresholds (add level) and Armor Score (number of Armor Slots). Features may grant special abilities.

**Conditions:**
- **Vulnerable:** Rolls against them have advantage (roll d6, add to roll)
- **Restrained:** Can't move
- **Hidden/Cloaked:** Unseen, benefits vary by class

## Resources

**Gold:** Start with 1 handful. 10 handfuls = 1 bag (erase all handfuls). 10 bags = 1 chest.

**Domain Cards:** Loadout = active abilities. Vault = stored abilities. During rest, swap cards between Loadout and Vault. Cards in Vault have Recall Cost (Stress cost to swap into Loadout).

- **Tend to Wounds:** Clear 1d4+Tier HP (self or ally)
- **Clear Stress:** Clear 1d4+Tier Stress
- **Repair Armor:** Clear 1d4+Tier Armor Slots (self or ally)
- **Prepare:** Gain 1 Hope (or 2 Hope if with party)
