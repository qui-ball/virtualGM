Fear/Hope pools update automatically for Duality Dice.\n  - Special case for Duality Dice: Always roll them together as a pair, i.e. roll_dice(2, \"d12\"), rather than rolling each die separately.\n- spend_fear(amount): Spend Fear tokens to take spotlight actions or activate GM abilities.\n</output_format>\n\n<sequencing>\nTool calls are sequential.

For the full official text, examples, and license terms, always refer to the Daggerheart SRD and the Darrington Press Community Gaming License. ([Daggerheart][1])\n\n---\n\n## 1. What Daggerheart Is\n\nDaggerheart is a fantasy tabletop role‑playing game for **1 Game Master (GM)** and **2–5 players**. Each player controls a **Player Character (PC)**; the GM portrays the world, its dangers, and all other characters.\n\nWhen the outcome of a character's action is uncertain, you roll a pair of twelve‑sided dice called **Duality Dice**: one die for **Hope**, one for **Fear**. Their total and which die is higher determine success, failure, and whether Hope or Fear grows at the table.\n\n## 2. Characters\n\nDuring character creation, you can fill in your character's **name, pronouns, and description** at **any point**; you don't have to decide them before choosing mechanics.\n\nEach PC is defined by:\n\n* **Class & Subclass**\n* **Heritage** (Ancestry + Community)\n* **Traits** and **Proficiency**\n* **Background**\n* **Experiences**\n* **Hit Points, Stress, Evasion, Hope**\n* **Weapons, armor, items**\n* **Domain cards (magic, techniques, abilities)**\n* **Connections** to other PCs\n\n### 2.1 Classes & Subclasses\n\nA **Class** is your broad adventuring role. It determines:\n\n* Which **two Domains** you can draw domain cards from\n* Starting **Evasion** and **Hit Points**\n* Your starting **equipment options**\n* One or more **class features**\n* A **Class Hope Feature** (a powerful ability that costs 3 Hope)\n* Level‑up options and subclass paths\n\nThe core SRD includes 9 classes:\n\n* **Bard** – Supportive performer and leader (Domains: *Codex & Grace*)\n* **Druid** – Nature shifter and spellcaster (*Arcana & Sage*)\n* **Guardian** – Defensive front‑liner (*Blade & Valor*)\n* **Ranger** – Scout and hunter, often with a companion (*Bone & Sage*)\n* **Rogue** – Sneaky specialist (*Grace & Midnight*)\n* **Seraph** – Holy champion (*Splendor & Valor*)\n* **Sorcerer** – Innate spellcaster (*Arcana & Midnight*)\n* **Warrior** – Weapon master (*Blade & Bone*)\n* **Wizard** – Learned mage (*Codex & Splendor*)\n\nEach class has **two subclasses**. Your subclass:\n\n* Sets your **Spellcast trait** (if any)\n* Grants a **Foundation feature** at level 1\n* Offers **Specialization** and **Mastery** features at higher levels\n\n> Example: The Bard's class feature, *Rally*, grants “Rally Dice” that allies can spend to boost rolls or clear Stress.\n\n**During character creation:**\n\n1. **Choose 1 class** from the list above.\n2. Take that class's **character sheet** and **character guide**.\n3. Apply your class's **starting class feature(s)** (usually printed near the bottom left of the class sheet). If a feature requires a choice, **make that choice now**.\n4. Choose **1 subclass** for your class.\n5. Take that subclass's **Foundation card** and apply its listed features.\n\n### 2.2 Heritage: Ancestry & Community\n\nYour **heritage** is a combination of:\n\n1. **Ancestry** – Species/lineage; grants physical traits and **two ancestry features**.\n2. **Community** – The culture/environment that raised you; grants a **community feature**.\n\nAt character creation:\n\n* Choose **1 Ancestry card** and **1 Community card**.\n* Record both under **“Heritage”** on your character sheet.\n* Gain that ancestry's **two ancestry features** and that community's **community feature**, as listed on the cards.\n\nThe SRD lists ancestries such as:\n**Clank, Drakona, Dwarf, Elf, Faerie, Faun, Firbolg, Fungril, Galapa, Giant, Goblin, Halfling, Human, Infernis, Katari, Orc, Ribbet, Simiah**. ([Daggerheart SRD][2])\n\n#### Mixed Ancestry\n\nInstead of choosing only one ancestry, you can create a **Mixed Ancestry**:\n\n* Choose **Ancestry A** and **Ancestry B**.\n* From Ancestry A, take the **top (1st‑listed) ancestry feature**.\n* From Ancestry B, take the **bottom (2nd‑listed) ancestry feature**.\n\nYou still record a single Heritage on your sheet, but note both ancestries in that entry.\n\n#### Communities\n\nCommunities include:\n**Highborne, Loreborne, Orderborne, Ridgeborne, Seaborne, Slyborne, Underborne, Wanderborne, Wildborne**. ([Daggerheart SRD][2])\n\nChoose 1 Community card, gain its **community feature**, and record it alongside your ancestry as part of your Heritage.\n\n### 2.3 Traits\n\nEvery character has six **Traits**, representing physical, mental, and social aptitude:\n\n* **Agility** – Speed, acrobatics, movement, dodging\n* **Strength** – Power, lifting, feats of might\n* **Finesse** – Precision, stealth, delicate work\n* **Instinct** – Perception, intuition, navigation\n* **Presence** – Charm, force of personality\n* **Knowledge** – Learning, analysis, problem‑solving\n\nAt character creation, assign these **modifiers** in any order:\n\n> **+2, +1, +1, +0, +0, −1**\n\nWhenever you **roll with a trait**, you add its modifier to your action roll total.\nRecord each trait's modifier on your character sheet.\n\n### 2.4 Proficiency\n\n**Proficiency** measures your skill with weapons and some other tasks:\n\n* At level 1, your Proficiency is **1**; write **1** in the **Proficiency** field on your character sheet.\n* Proficiency usually determines **how many damage dice** you roll with a weapon\n  (e.g., Proficiency 2 with a `d8+2` weapon → roll **`2d8+2`**).\n* **Proficiency increases the number of dice**, not the flat bonus: a `d6+1` weapon with Proficiency 1 is `1d6+1`; with Proficiency 2 it's `2d6+1`, and so on.\n* Proficiency increases at **levels 2, 5, and 8** via tier achievements.\n\n### 2.5 Core Resources: HP, Stress, Evasion, Hope\n\nAt the end of character creation, you record your starting resources:\n\n* **Level** – All PCs start at **level 1**. Record **Level 1** at the top of your character sheet.\n* **Hit Points (HP)** – Abstract physical health; set by class. Your class sheet gives your starting HP; **record that value** on your character sheet. When you take enough damage, you **mark HP boxes** instead of tracking exact numbers.\n* **Stress** – Tracks mental, emotional, and physical strain. All PCs begin with **6 Stress slots**; **mark 6 empty Stress boxes** on your sheet.\n* **Evasion** – How hard you are to hit; most attack rolls against you compare to your Evasion.\n\n  * At character creation, find the value printed **directly beneath the Evasion field** on your class sheet and **copy that number** into the Evasion field on your character sheet.\n  * Features and conditions can later modify your Evasion.\n* **Hope** – A shared metacurrency for PC abilities. Each PC starts with **2 Hope** and can hold up to 6 at once; **mark 2 Hope** in the Hope field.\n\n#### 2.5.1 Damage Thresholds\n\nArmor and level combine to give each PC two damage thresholds: **Major** and **Severe**.\n\nWhen you take **incoming damage** (after reductions like armor, resistance, etc.):\n\n* If damage ≥ Severe threshold → **mark 3 HP**\n* If damage ≥ Major but < Severe → **mark 2 HP**\n* If damage < Major but > 0 → **mark 1 HP**\n* If damage is reduced to 0 or less → **mark no HP**\n\nOptional rule: Taking damage equal to **twice** your Severe threshold can mark **4 HP**.\n\nIf you **mark your last HP**, you **fall** and must choose a **death move** (see §7).\n\n#### 2.5.2 Stress\n\nStress represents psychological wear and tear or strenuous effort:\n\n* Various effects cause you to **mark Stress**.\n* If you must mark Stress but have no empty Stress box, mark **1 HP** instead.\n* If all Stress boxes are marked, you gain the **Vulnerable** condition until at least 1 Stress is cleared.\n* You cannot use moves that *require* you to mark Stress if you have no free Stress boxes.\n\nStress is usually cleared by **rests**, **downtime moves**, or features.\n\n### 2.6 Weapons, Armor, Items\n\n#### 2.6.1 Weapons & Proficiency\n\nAt level 1, choose your starting weapons from the **Tier 1 Weapon tables**:\n\n* Choose **one** of:\n\n  * **One two‑handed primary weapon**, **or**\n  * **One one‑handed primary weapon and one one‑handed secondary weapon**.\n\nRecord your choice in the **Active Weapon** field(s) on your character sheet.\n\nEach weapon lists:\n\n* The **trait** used for attacks (often Strength, Finesse, or Agility)\n* **Range** (Melee, Very Close, Close, Far, Very Far)\n* Its **damage dice** (e.g., `d6+1`, `d8+2`)\n* Any special properties or features\n\nYour **Proficiency** sets how many damage dice you roll:\n\n* Proficiency 1 with a `d6+1` weapon → roll **`1d6+1`**.\n* Proficiency 2 with a `d8+2` weapon → roll **`2d8+2`**.\n* Proficiency affects **how many damage dice you roll**, **not** the flat bonus.\n\n#### 2.6.2 Armor, Thresholds & Armor Score\n\nAt level 1, choose **1 set of armor** from the **Tier 1 Armor table** and record it in the **Active Armor** field.\n\nArmor provides:\n\n* A **Base Armor Score**\n* **Base damage thresholds** (two numbers, usually labeled **Major** and **Severe**)\n* A limited number of **Armor Slots** (marking these reduces incoming damage; details depend on the armor)\n\nTo determine your thresholds at character creation:\n\n1. Take the armor's **Base Thresholds**.\n2. Add your **character level** to each (so at level 1, add **+1** to both).\n3. Record the resulting **Major** and **Severe** thresholds on your sheet.\n\nYour **Armor Score** is:\n\n> **Armor Score = equipped armor's Base Score + any permanent bonuses**\n> from abilities, features, or other lasting effects.\n\nRecord this total in the **Armor Score** field (top left of your sheet).\n\nYou may only have **one set of Active Armor** equipped at a time.\nYour **Active Weapon** entry holds either a single two‑handed weapon or a one‑handed primary plus a one‑handed secondary; other weapons you carry are considered backup gear.\n\n#### 2.6.3 Starting Inventory\n\nIn addition to weapons and armor, at character creation add the following to your **Inventory**:\n\n* **Standard gear**\n\n  * 1 torch\n  * 50 feet of rope\n  * Basic supplies\n  * A handful of gold\n    *Mark **one box** in “Gold ➝ Handfuls” on the left‑hand column of your sheet.*\n\n* **Choose 1 potion**\n\n  * **Minor Health Potion** – when used, clear **1d4 HP**, **or**\n  * **Minor Stamina Potion** – when used, clear **1d4 Stress**.\n\n* **Class items**\n\n  * **One class‑specific item** from your character guide.\n  * If applicable, the **class‑specific item used to carry your spells** (such as a grimoire, focus, or holy symbol).\n\n* **Optional items**\n\n  * Any other **GM‑approved items** you want at the start of play.\n\nYour class sheet and character guide may refine or expand these starting options; if there's ever a conflict, use the printed class/ancestry/community/domain cards as the final say.\n\n### 2.7 Experiences\n\nAn **Experience** is a short phrase that captures a specific skill set, background, or knack your character has.\n\n* At level 1 you choose **two Experiences**, each with a **+2 modifier**.\n* Experiences should be **specific but flexible** (“Streetwise Informant”) rather than universal (“Good at Everything” or “Highly Skilled”).\n* Experiences **do not grant specific mechanical powers by themselves**—they shouldn't be things like “Supersonic Flight” or “Invulnerable.”\n* You gain additional Experiences at **levels 2, 5, and 8**, each starting at +2.\n\nWhen your PC **makes a move** or any other important roll, you can **spend 1 Hope** to **Utilize an Experience**:\n\n* Choose **one relevant Experience** and **add its modifier** to that action roll's total.\n\nThis is the primary mechanical use of Experiences; on their own they are descriptive, not always‑on bonuses.\n\n### 2.8 Domains & Domain Cards\n\n**Domains** are themed decks of cards that provide spells, abilities, and magical grimoires. The SRD defines **nine Domains**, such as Arcana, Blade, Bone, Codex, Grace, Midnight, Sage, Splendor, and Valor, each with a distinct fantasy flavor.\n\nEach **domain card** includes:\n\n* **Level** (1–10; you may only take cards at or below your level)\n* **Domain icon** (must be one of your class's two domains)\n* **Recall Cost** (Stress you pay to swap this card from vault into loadout mid‑adventure)\n* **Type** (Ability, Spell, or Grimoire)\n* Name and rules text for its features\n\n#### Loadout & Vault\n\n* Your **loadout** is up to **5 domain cards** currently ready for use.\n* Any additional cards you own are stored in your **vault**.\n* During downtime, you can freely rearrange which 5 cards are in your loadout.\n* During adventures, you may pay each card's **Recall Cost** (Stress) to swap it with another card of the same domain and level from your vault.\n\nAt character creation:\n\n* Each class has access to **2 of the 9 Domains** in the core set (listed on your class sheet).\n* Choose **2 level‑1 Domain cards** from those allowed Domains:\n\n  * Either **1 card from each Domain**, or\n  * **2 cards from a single Domain**.\n* Take those cards and apply their rules.\n\n### 2.9 Connections\n\n**Connections** define relationships between the PCs.\n\nA simple Session 0 procedure:\n\n1. **Description round**\n\n   * Each player briefly describes their PC to the group:\n\n     * Name, pronouns, character description\n     * Their Experiences\n     * Key answers to the background questions in their character guide\n\n2. **Discussion**\n\n   * Use the **“Connections”** section of your character guide as inspiration.\n   * Discuss possible relationships between PCs (old friendships, debts, rivalries, shared history, etc.).\n\n3. **Propose connections**\n\n   * Each player suggests **at least one connection** between their character and **each other PC**.\n   * Other players may **accept or reject** any suggested connection.\n\n4. **Consent & flexibility**\n\n   * A player may reject a proposed connection **for any reason**.\n   * It is **not required** for every pair of PCs to have a pre‑established connection.\n   * Additional connections can be **discovered and developed during play**.\n\nYou don't need to phrase Connections in mechanical terms—they're story hooks the GM and players can call on later.\n\n### 2.10 Background & Backstory\n\nYour **background** is the story of who your character was before the campaign begins.\n\n* During character creation, answer the **background questions** in your character guide.\n* You may **modify or replace** these questions to better fit your character concept.\n* **Mechanical rule:** Your background has **no explicit mechanical effect**—it doesn't directly grant bonuses, Experiences, or abilities.\n\nAs you flesh out your background, you're free to **adjust earlier choices** (class details, heritage, traits, etc.) so the mechanics better reflect the story you're telling.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Core Gameplay & Spotlight\n\n### 3.1 Core Loop\n\nThe game's core loop works like this:\n\n1. **Set the Scene** – The GM describes where you are, what's happening, and any immediate threats or opportunities.\n2. **Ask & Answer Questions** – Players ask about the environment and details; the GM answers (and can ask questions back) to collaboratively build out the fiction.\n3. **Act & Resolve** – Players describe what their characters do. If an action is risky or uncertain, the GM calls for a roll. The results change the fiction.\n4. **Repeat** – The scene continues until natural closure or a mechanical trigger (like a rest, countdown reaching 0, or scene‑ending ability).\n\n### 3.2 Spotlight & Turn Flow\n\nDaggerheart does **not** use fixed initiative or fixed “actions per turn.” Instead, it uses the **spotlight**, an informal token representing whose character currently drives the scene.\n\n* Whoever currently has the spotlight describes what their character does.\n* After that move resolves, the spotlight passes to:\n\n  * Whoever the fiction naturally focuses on,\n  * Someone who hasn't acted in a while, or\n  * Whoever a mechanical trigger specifies (for example, some GM moves or adversary features).\n\n**Optional Spotlight Tracker:** Groups who prefer a more “turn‑based” feel can give each player a few tokens per scene (e.g., 3). Each time a player has the spotlight, they spend a token. When everyone runs out, everyone refills for the next cycle.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Rolls & Duality Dice\n\n### 4.1 When to Roll\n\nYou **only roll** when:\n\n* The outcome of a move is **uncertain**, and\n* Failure would be interesting or consequential.\n\nIf success is trivial or failure would be dull, the GM simply describes success.\n\n### 4.2 Action Roll Procedure\n\nMost rolls are **action rolls**, used when a character attempts something risky.\n\n**To make an action roll:**\n\n1. **Choose a Trait**\n   The GM and player agree which trait best applies, based on how the action is described. Some moves specify a particular trait (e.g., “Strength Roll (12)”).\n\n2. **Set the Difficulty**\n\n   * Some features list a fixed Difficulty.\n   * Otherwise, the GM sets a Difficulty based on circumstances and may or may not say the number aloud, but should always state the stakes and possible consequences.\n\n3. **Add Mods & Extra Dice**\n   Before rolling, the acting player decides whether to:\n\n   * Spend Hope to **Utilize an Experience** (spend 1 Hope to add one relevant Experience's modifier),\n   * Use features that grant **advantage**, **Rally dice**, or other bonuses,\n   * Spend Hope on class/domain features that modify the roll.\n     All of these must be declared **before** rolling unless a feature specifically says it can be used afterward.\n\n4. **Roll**\n\n   * Roll your **Duality Dice** (Hope d12 and Fear d12).\n   * Add:\n\n     * Trait modifier,\n     * Any Experience modifier (if paid for with Hope),\n     * Advantage and Rally dice (if any).\n   * Compute your **total**.\n\n5. **Interpret the Result**\n   Compare the total to the Difficulty and check which Duality Die is higher.\n\n   * **Success with Hope** – Total ≥ Difficulty, and **Hope die > Fear die**\n     You succeed and gain **1 Hope**.\n   * **Success with Fear** – Total ≥ Difficulty, and **Fear die > Hope die**\n     You succeed, but there is a cost, complication, or twist. The GM also gains **1 Fear**.\n   * **Failure with Hope** – Total < Difficulty, and **Hope die > Fear die**\n     You fail, but in a way that still offers a silver lining or minor benefit. You gain **1 Hope** and the spotlight usually shifts to the GM.\n   * **Failure with Fear** – Total < Difficulty, and **Fear die > Hope die**\n     You fail with a big consequence. The GM gains **1 Fear** and takes the spotlight.\n   * **Critical Success** – The Hope and Fear dice show the **same number**\n     You automatically succeed with an extra benefit, **gain 1 Hope**, and **clear 1 Stress**. If this was an attack roll, you deal **critical damage** (see §5.3). Crits are always treated as “rolled with Hope.”\n\nAfter the outcome is resolved, the table cooperates to describe how the fiction changes.\n\n### 4.3 Hope & Fear\n\n**Hope** and **Fear** are shared meta‑currencies for dramatic swings in power.\n\n#### 4.3.1 Hope (Players)\n\n* PCs start with **2 Hope** and can hold up to **6** at once.\n* Hope persists between sessions.\n* You **gain Hope** mainly from:\n\n  * Success with Hope,\n  * Failure with Hope,\n  * Some class/domain features and downtime options.\n\nPlayers can **spend Hope** to:\n\n1. **Help an Ally**\n\n   * Describe how you assist.\n   * Spend 1 Hope and roll a **d6 advantage die**.\n   * The acting player adds the highest advantage die from all helpers to their roll.\n\n2. **Utilize an Experience**\n\n   * Spend **1 Hope**.\n   * Choose one relevant Experience and **add its modifier** to your roll.\n\n3. **Initiate a Tag Team Roll**\n\n   * Spend **3 Hope** to combine your action with another PC's action (see §4.5).\n\n4. **Activate Hope Features**\n\n   * Many class/domain features list a cost in Hope (often 3) to trigger a powerful effect.\n   * If you rolled with Hope, you may immediately spend the Hope gained from that roll on the feature.\n\n#### 4.3.2 Fear (GM)\n\nThe GM holds a pool of **Fear tokens**.\n\n* Start of campaign: Typically **1 Fear per PC** in the party.\n* GM gains Fear when:\n\n  * A PC's roll resolves **with Fear**,\n  * The party rests (see Downtime),\n  * Features or environments explicitly say so.\n\nThe GM can hold up to **12 Fear**, which carries over between sessions.\n\nThe GM can **spend Fear** to:\n\n* Interrupt and seize the spotlight,\n* Make an extra GM move,\n* Activate an adversary or environment **Fear Feature**,\n* Add an adversary's Experience to an attack or action roll, or otherwise intensify a scene. ([Daggerheart SRD][2])\n\n### 4.4 Special Roll Types\n\n#### 4.4.1 Trait Rolls\n\nA rule that says “Agility Roll (13)” is a **trait roll**:\n\n* It is an action roll using that specific trait at the listed Difficulty.\n* Any feature that affects that trait applies here as well.\n* Effects that modify “Agility rolls” also apply to **attacks**, **Spellcast rolls**, or other action rolls that use Agility.\n\n#### 4.4.2 Spellcast Rolls\n\n**Spellcast Rolls** are trait rolls that always use your **Spellcast trait**, which comes from your subclass. You only roll Spellcast when a card or feature says you do.\n\n#### 4.4.3 Attack Rolls\n\nAn **attack roll** is an action roll whose goal is to inflict damage.\n\n* Use the trait specified by the weapon or spell (e.g., Strength for a greatsword, Finesse for a rapier).\n* Most attacks against PCs compare the roll total to the target's **Evasion**.\n* Attacks against adversaries compare to the adversary's **Difficulty** value instead.\n\nOn a **hit**, you roll **damage** (see below) and then apply thresholds to see how many HP are marked (§2.5.1).\n\n#### 4.4.4 Reaction Rolls\n\nA **reaction roll** represents a character's attempt to dodge, endure, or mitigate an imminent effect (a falling boulder, a breath weapon, etc.).\n\n* Follows the normal action roll procedure, but:\n\n  * Reaction rolls **do not** generate Hope or Fear.\n  * They do not trigger extra GM moves.\n  * Other PCs cannot Help an Ally on your reaction roll (unless a feature explicitly says otherwise).\n* A critical success on a reaction roll ignores the effect entirely but does **not** grant Hope or clear Stress.\n\n#### 4.4.5 Group Action Rolls\n\nWhen multiple PCs team up on one task:\n\n* One PC is the **leader** and makes an action roll normally.\n* Each assisting PC makes a **reaction roll** using whatever trait makes sense.\n* For each **success**, the leader gets **+1** to their roll; for each **failure**, they suffer **−1**.\n\n#### 4.4.6 Tag Team Rolls\n\nOnce per session per player, a PC may initiate a **Tag Team Roll** (cost: 3 Hope):\n\n* Two PCs narrate how they combine their actions.\n* Each rolls a full action roll separately.\n* Before resolving, the players choose **one** of the two results and apply it to **both actions**.\n* On a roll with Hope, **each** participating PC gains 1 Hope; on a roll with Fear, the GM gains 1 Fear per PC involved.\n* On a successful Tag‑Team attack, both roll damage and **add totals together** as if from a single strike.\n\nTag Team Rolls count as **one action roll** for countdowns and similar tracking effects.\n\n### 4.5 Advantage, Disadvantage, Rally Dice\n\n#### 4.5.1 Advantage & Disadvantage\n\nSome effects grant **advantage** or **disadvantage** on a roll:\n\n* **Advantage:** Roll a **d6 advantage die** and add it to your total.\n* **Disadvantage:** Roll a **d6 disadvantage die** and subtract it from your total.\n\nRules:\n\n* Advantage and disadvantage dice cancel one‑for‑one if they would be added to the **same** dice pool (so you never roll them both for the same player at once).\n* External sources of advantage/disadvantage (like another player's Help roll) can stack with your own.\n\n#### 4.5.2 Rally Dice\n\nSome classes (notably Bards) can grant **Rally Dice**:\n\n* Typically once per session, a feature lets you hand out a **Rally die** (starting as a **d6**, upgraded to **d8** at higher levels).\n* A PC can spend their Rally die to:\n\n  * Add it to an action or reaction roll,\n  * Boost a damage roll,\n  * Or clear Stress equal to the die's value.\n\nUnspent Rally dice usually clear at the end of the session unless a feature states otherwise.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Combat\n\nCombat is not mechanically separate from the rest of play; it just emphasizes **positioning**, **damage**, and **threats** more heavily.\n\n### 5.1 Ranges & Movement\n\nDaggerheart uses abstract **range bands** which can be mapped to grids if desired.\n\n* **Melee:** Touch range.\n* **Very Close:** A few steps away.\n* **Close:** Within a short sprint or quick move.\n* **Far:** Bowshot distance.\n* **Very Far:** Well beyond a single sprint; long‑range or sniping distance.\n\nBasic movement:\n\n* PCs can usually reposition **within Close range** as part of a move or attack.\n* Moving farther (e.g., from Melee to Far, or across the battlefield under fire) may require an **Agility roll** or an action.\n\nLine of sight and cover:\n\n* You need **line of sight** to make most ranged attacks.\n* Targets behind partial cover impose **disadvantage** on attacks against them.\n* Total cover means the attack cannot be made.\n\n### 5.2 Attacking\n\n1. Narrate the attack and choose the target(s).\n2. Determine which trait the attack uses (weapon, spell, or ability text).\n3. Make an **attack roll** against the target's **Evasion** (for PCs) or **Difficulty** (for adversaries).\n4. On success, roll damage and apply thresholds to mark HP.\n\nMulti‑target attacks:\n\n* If a spell or ability strikes multiple targets, you often:\n\n  * Make **one attack roll**,\n  * Make **one damage roll**, and\n  * Compare the attack roll to each target individually; damage applies as appropriate.\n\n### 5.3 Damage Types & Critical Damage\n\n* There are two damage types:\n\n  * **Physical (phy)**\n  * **Magic (mag)**\n\nSome creatures may have:\n\n* **Resistance** – Halve incoming damage of that type before thresholds.\n* **Immunity** – Ignore damage of that type entirely.\n* **Direct Damage** – A special kind of damage that **cannot** be reduced by armor slots or similar effects.\n\n**Critical Damage:** On a critical success attack (matching Duality Dice), you:\n\n1. Roll damage as usual.\n2. Add the **maximum possible value** of all the damage dice to the total.\n\n   * Example: `2d8+1` becomes `2d8+1+16` on a crit.\n\n### 5.4 Conditions\n\nSome effects apply **Conditions**:\n\n* **Hidden** – Enemies can't see you and don't know where you are; actions targeting you are rolled with disadvantage. You lose Hidden when you visibly emerge, attack, or are otherwise revealed.\n* **Restrained** – You can't move but can still act from your space (unless further limited).\n* **Vulnerable** – Any roll targeting you is rolled with advantage.\n\nOther conditions may be special to certain features:\n\n* **Temporary conditions** often include rules for how the affected creature can clear them—typically by using an action and succeeding at an appropriate roll.\n* **Special conditions** specify unique requirements for removal (e.g., a particular ritual, item, or spell).\n\n### 5.5 GM Combat Flow & Adversary Actions\n\nThe GM does not roll Duality Dice; instead, they use a **single d20 (the GM's Die)** for adversary attacks and rare adversary action rolls.\n\nWhen an adversary attacks a PC:\n\n1. Roll d20 + **Attack Modifier**.\n2. If total ≥ target's **Evasion**, the attack hits.\n3. Roll the damage dice listed in the adversary stat block; the PC marks HP accordingly.\n\nOn a natural 20:\n\n* The adversary's attack automatically hits and deals **critical damage**: roll damage as normal and **add the maximum result** of the damage dice to the total.\n\nWhen the **spotlight is on the GM**, they may:\n\n* Spotlight an adversary to:\n\n  * Move and attack,\n  * Use a special action,\n  * Clear a condition,\n  * Sprint across the battlefield, or\n  * Take any other fictionally appropriate move.\n* Spend Fear to spotlight additional adversaries or use **Fear Features**.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Downtime, Rest, & Recovery\n\nBetween conflicts, the party can take **rests** to recover resources and advance personal projects.\n\n### 6.1 Short Rest\n\nA **short rest** is roughly an hour of in‑world downtime.\n\nDuring a short rest:\n\n1. Each PC may freely move domain cards between loadout and vault.\n2. Each PC chooses **two downtime moves** (and may repeat the same move):\n\n   Typical short‑rest moves include:\n\n   * **Tend to Wounds** – Clear a small amount of HP (e.g., `1d4 + Tier`).\n   * **Clear Stress** – Clear `1d4 + Tier` Stress.\n   * **Repair Armor** – Clear `1d4 + Tier` Armor Slots on one set of armor.\n   * **Prepare** – Describe how you get ready; gain 1 Hope, or 2 Hope if you prepare alongside one or more party members.\n\nAt the end of a short rest:\n\n* Abilities that refresh **“per rest”** reset.\n* Effects lasting **“until your next rest”** end.\n* The GM gains **1d4 Fear** as a downtime consequence.\n\n### 6.2 Long Rest\n\nA **long rest** is several hours of sleep or deep relaxation (often overnight).\n\nDuring a long rest:\n\n1. Again, each PC can freely swap domain cards between vault and loadout.\n2. Each PC chooses **two downtime moves** from the long‑rest list, such as:\n\n   * **Tend to All Wounds** – Clear all HP for yourself or an ally.\n   * **Clear All Stress**.\n   * **Repair All Armor** – Clear all Armor Slots on one set of armor.\n   * **Prepare** – As above (often granting Hope).\n   * **Work on a Project** – Progress a long‑term project tied to a countdown (like crafting or research).\n\nAt the end of a long rest:\n\n* Limited‑use abilities that refresh per rest or **per long rest** reset.\n* Ongoing effects that last until your next (long) rest end.\n* The GM gains **1d4 + number of PCs** Fear and can advance a long‑term countdown of their choice.\n\n**Rest Rules:**\n\n* If a party takes **three short rests in a row**, the next rest must be a **long rest**.\n* If a rest is interrupted by danger, benefits can be reduced or lost (e.g., a long rest may only count as a short rest if you're attacked during it).\n\n---\n\n## 7. Death, Scars, & End of the Journey\n\nWhen a PC marks their **last HP**, they fall and must choose a **death move**: ([Daggerheart SRD][3])\n\n1. **Blaze of Glory**\n\n   * Take one final action that automatically critically succeeds (with GM approval).\n   * After this moment of heroism, your character dies.\n\n2. **Avoid Death**\n\n   * Your character collapses unconscious.\n   * You and the GM describe how the situation worsens for the party.\n   * You can't act, move, or be targeted by attacks until an ally clears at least 1 of your marked HP or the party finishes a long rest.\n   * After each time you fall this way, roll your Hope die:\n\n     * If the result is ≤ your level, you gain a **scar**:\n\n       * Permanently cross out a Hope slot.\n       * Work with the GM to define its lasting narrative impact and possible ways to heal it (if any).\n     * If you ever cross out your **final Hope slot**, your journey ends.\n\n3. **Risk It All**\n\n   * Roll your Duality Dice:\n\n     * If **Hope > Fear** – You stay standing and **clear HP and/or Stress equal to the Hope die** (split as you like).\n     * If **Fear > Hope** – You die.\n     * If **dice match** – You remain standing but clear **no** HP or Stress (note: the SRD's latest version clarifies that matching dice keep you up with no recovery; earlier text differs slightly—use the version your table prefers). ([Daggerheart SRD][3])\n\nIf a PC dies, you and the GM create a new character at the party's current level before the next session.\n\n---\n\n## 8. Leveling Up & Advancement\n\nThe GM decides when the party reaches a **narrative milestone** that warrants leveling up (roughly every 3 sessions). All PCs level up together.\n\nThere are **10 levels** divided into **4 tiers**:\n\n* Tier 1: Level 1\n* Tier 2: Levels 2–4\n* Tier 3: Levels 5–7\n* Tier 4: Levels 8–10\n\nWhen you level up:\n\n### 8.1 Step 1 – Tier Achievements\n\nAt specific levels you gain automatic benefits:\n\n* **Level 2:**\n\n  * New +2 Experience\n  * +1 Proficiency\n* **Level 5:**\n\n  * New +2 Experience\n  * +1 Proficiency\n  * Clear “marked traits” so you can raise them again in later tiers\n* **Level 8:**\n\n  * New +2 Experience\n  * +1 Proficiency\n  * Clear marked traits\n\n### 8.2 Step 2 – Advancements (2 choices)\n\nChoose **two advancements** from your tier or lower (some options require both picks).\n\nExamples of advancement types:\n\n* Increase two unmarked Traits by +1 (and mark them so you can't raise them again until a later tier).\n* Gain additional **HP slots** or **Stress slots** permanently.\n* Increase one Experience by +1.\n* Increase **Evasion** by +1.\n* Take an additional **domain card** from your class's domains (or from your multiclass domain, if applicable).\n* Gain an **upgraded subclass card** (specialization/mastery).\n* Increase Proficiency (requires using both advancement choices).\n* **Multiclass** (from level 5+; also uses both advancement choices).\n\n### 8.3 Step 3 – Damage Thresholds\n\nIncrease all your **damage thresholds by 1** (Major and Severe).\n\n### 8.4 Step 4 – Domain Cards\n\nChoose a new domain card at or below your level from your class's domains and add it to your loadout or vault. You may also swap one previously acquired card for another of the same level.\n\n### 8.5 Multiclassing\n\nFrom **level 5** onward, you can choose to **multiclass** as an advancement:\n\n* Pick a second class.\n* Gain its **class feature** and access to **one of its domains**.\n* Add its multiclass module to your character sheet.\n* Take a **foundation card** from one of that class's subclasses.\n* When gaining new domain cards, you may instead choose from the multiclass domain, up to **half your level (rounded up)**.\n\nTaking multiclass normally replaces some other advancement options, as described in the SRD.\n\n---\n\n## 9. GM Guidance & Tools\n\nThis section summarizes the GM‑side rules and tools.\n\n### 9.1 GM Principles & Practices\n\nThe SRD gives GMs a suite of principles, such as:\n\n* Be curious about players' ideas.\n* Keep the story moving (every roll should change the situation).\n* Cut to the action when scenes drag.\n* Help players use the game's mechanics.\n* Ground NPC actions in their motives.\n* Spend Fear generously; players will generate more.\n\nAnd pitfalls to avoid, like undermining the PCs, over‑planning, or hoarding Fear.\n\n### 9.2 GM Moves\n\nThe GM makes **moves** when:\n\n* A player rolls with Fear.\n* A player fails an action roll.\n* A character's actions invite consequences.\n* Players look to the GM for what happens next.\n\nGM moves can include:\n\n* Show signs of an approaching threat.\n* Reveal unwelcome truths.\n* Separate PCs.\n* Deal damage or mark Stress.\n* Introduce new adversaries, hazards, or countdowns.\n* Spend Fear to trigger powerful adversary or environment features.\n\n### 9.3 Countdowns\n\n**Countdowns** track looming events, such as a ritual completing or reinforcements arriving.\n\n* A countdown has a starting value (e.g., 3, 5, or 10).\n* When it **advances**, the value is reduced by 1.\n* When it reaches **0**, its effect occurs (a portal opens, a building collapses, etc.).\n\nTypes:\n\n* **Standard countdowns:** Tick down once every time a player makes an action roll.\n* **Dynamic countdowns:** Advancement depends on roll outcomes:\n\n  * Success with Hope → progress countdowns might tick down more,\n  * Failures with Fear → consequence countdowns may drop faster, etc. (the SRD includes a full advancement table).\n* **Looping**, **increasing**, **decreasing**, **linked**, and **long‑term** countdowns offer more complex pacing tools.\n\n### 9.4 Encounter Building\n\nThe SRD offers a **Battle Points** guideline:\n\n* Start with approximately **(3 × number of PCs) + 2** Battle Points.\n* Adjust up or down depending on desired difficulty, adversary tiers, and whether you include major threats such as Leaders or Solos.\n* Spend Battle Points to “buy” adversaries of different roles (Minions, Standard, Bruisers, Ranged, Skulks, Leaders, Solos, etc.). ([Daggerheart SRD][2])\n\nThis produces fast, deadly battles with room for GM improvisation.\n\n---\n\n## 10. Optional & Advanced Rules\n\nA few additional tools from the SRD you can include as needed:\n\n* **Fate Rolls:** For outcomes entirely left to chance (“Do the reinforcements arrive in time?”), the GM can ask a player to roll one Duality die and interpret the result against a simple scale.\n* **GM‑run Allies:** Important friendly NPCs can be run with simple features and narrative positioning rather than full stat blocks.\n* **Loot Tables & Magic Items:** The SRD includes rollable tables for magical trinkets and unusual gear; the GM can freely re‑skin or replace them for tone.\n* **Companions:** Some classes (e.g., Ranger) can have animal or spirit companions with their own Stress, Experiences, and attacks.\n\n---\n\n## 11. Using This Ruleset\n\nYou can treat this markdown ruleset as:\n\n* A **reference** for players learning how Daggerheart works.\n* A **foundation** for house‑rules and homebrew content.\n* An overview to complement the full Daggerheart SRD, which includes all card text, example adversaries, domain references, and the official legal language for publishing compatible content. ([Daggerheart][1])\n</daggerheart_rules>\n\n<campaign_material>\n# Campaign Overview\n\n> *\"Marlowe Fairwind, the right-hand sorcerer of King Emeris, has gathered her most trusted allies to carry an important package to Hush, a small village within the ancient forest of Sablewood. The crate is large, heavy, and sealed with magic, addressed to the Whitefire Arcanist. You've been given a map and a carriage, and the promise of reward upon your arrival.\"*\n\n\n## Character: Marlowe Fairwind  \n**Loreborne Elf Sorcerer**\n\n---\n\n### Overview\n\nMarlowe Fairwind is the personal mage to King Emeris and is responsible for gathering you for this mission. She is calm and collected—until she isn't. A trusted ally, Marlowe is a blend of intellect and magical prowess.\n\n---\n\n#### **Background Breakdown**\n\n**Community:**  \n*Marlowe is Loreborne*, hailing from a society where knowledge and learning are of utmost importance.\n\n**Ancestry:**  \n*Elf.* She has long, pointed ears and acutely attuned senses.\n\n**Class & Subclass:**  \n*Sorcerer (Primal Origin).* Marlowe can uniquely manipulate and shape the magic she casts.\n\n**Experience Tags:**  \n- *Royal Mage*  \n- *Not On My Watch*  \nShe can use these experiences during play when appropriate.\n\n**Weapon:**  \n*Dualstaff* — can strike targets at Far range. On a hit, it deals **1d6+3 magic damage**.\n\n\n## Community: Loreborne\n\nBeing part of a **Loreborne** community means you hail from a society that values academic achievement and political savvy above all else.\n\n> **Talent: Well-Read**  \n> _You have advantage on rolls involving the history, culture, or politics of a prominent person or place._\n\n---\n\n## Ancestry: Elf\n\nElves are typically tall humanoids, easily recognized by their pointed ears and finely tuned senses.\n\n**Ancestral Abilities:**\n\n- **Quick Reactions:**  \n  _Mark a Stress to gain advantage on a reaction roll._\n\n- **Celestial Trance:**  \n  _During a rest, you can enter a trance, allowing you to choose one additional downtime move._\n\n---\n\n## Subclass: Sorcerer (Primal Origin)\n\n**Foundation | Spellcast Trait: Instinct**\n\nYour primal origin grants you the ability to manipulate and reshape the very essence of magic.\n\n> **Manipulate Magic:**  \n> _After casting a spell or attacking with a magic weapon, you may mark a Stress to choose one of the following enhancements:_\n> - Extend the spell or attack's reach by one range increment  \n> - Gain a +2 bonus to your action roll  \n> - Double a damage die of your choice  \n> - Hit an additional target within range\n\n---\n\n### Domain Spell: Unleash Chaos\n\nAt the start of each session, place a number of tokens on this card equal to your Spellcast trait.\n\n- Make a Spellcast Roll against a target within **Far** range.\n- Spend any number of tokens to channel raw magic.  \n- On a success, roll as many d10s as tokens spent and deal that much magic damage to the target.\n- You may mark a Stress to replenish these tokens (up to your Spellcast trait).\n- At session end, any unspent tokens are cleared.\n\n---\n\n### Domain Spell: Rain of Blades\n\n- **Cost:** Spend a Hope.\n- **Effect:** Make a Spellcast Roll and conjure spectral blades striking all targets within **Very Close** range.\n  - On success, deal **1d8+2 magic damage** (using your Proficiency) to each affected target.\n  - If a target is _Vulnerable_, they take an additional **1d8** damage.\n\n---\n\n## The Sablewood\n\nThe Sablewood is a vast, seemingly endless forest, its ancient, dark trees stretching hundreds of feet into the sky. Some locals claim these trees have stood since the time before the Forgotten Gods. The forest is renowned not just for its towering arboreal giants, but also for its unique variety of hybrid animals, such as lemur-toads, tiger-elks, cat-squirrels, and the infamous eeligator. \n\nThese creatures range from benign to deadly:  \n- **Cat-squirrels** might gently feed from your hand,  \n- while an **eeligator** can suddenly burst from a riverbank, eager to snatch a careless traveler.\n\nInterwoven throughout the forest are well-worn trade routes, traveled by merchants and wanderers alike.\n\n---\n\n### Hush: The Village Within the Woods\n\nNestled deep in the Sablewood is the small, welcoming village of **Hush**, which serves as the primary destination for the player character during this adventure.\n\n- There are **no inns** in Hush; instead, **all travelers** are treated as honored guests and offered hospitality in the homes of the villagers.\n- Many of Hush's people—and others who dwell in the Sablewood—still worship the enigmatic **Forgotten Gods**, though these deities are now nameless.\n\n---\n\n### The Whitefire Arcanist\n\nThe spiritual and magical anchor of Hush is the **Whitefire Arcanist**, leader of the village's primary religious order. The Arcanist is responsible for maintaining the powerful wards that safeguard Hush from the Sablewood's dangers.\n\n---\n\nThis mystical, ancient woodland and its peculiar, tight-knit village set the scene for the adventure to come.\n\n\n\n## Narrative Overview\n\n### Act One: The Merchant Cart\n\nOn your way to Hush, you encounter an overturned merchant cart blocking your path. A strixwolf—a fearsome creature with the body of a wolf and the face of an owl—is feeding on the driver's corpse.\n\n---\n\n### Act Two: Thicket Thieves\n\nAfter recovering from the initial shock, you are ambushed by Thistlefolk. These small, bramble-dwelling folk attempt to steal the carriage that holds your important delivery.\n\n---\n\n### Act Three: Seeking an Arcanist\n\nOnce you arrive safely in Hush, your next challenge is to seek out the elusive Whitefire Arcanist. To find her, you must talk to the local townspeople and piece together clues about her whereabouts.\n\n---\n\n### Act Four: The Treehouse\n\nUpon opening your mysterious crate, you discover that the package is actually the keystone from the capital city gate's main archway. King Emeris has sent it to the Arcanist so that she may repair the ward which protects the city. The Arcanist enlists your help to ward off danger while she works to complete the ritual needed to restore its magic.\n\n---\n\n### Act Five: The Ward Renewal\n\nYou, along with the Whitefire Arcanist, transport the keystone to the ritual site. While the Arcanist performs her magic, magical creatures begin to invade, and you must fight them off until the ritual is complete.\n\n---\n\n## About the Thistlefolk\n\nThe Thistlefolk make their homes where few dare tread: deep within the thickest, most tangled brambles of the Sablewood. Although the only Thistlefolk that most travelers ever see are those who venture out to steal goods from passing merchants, this has given them an undeserved reputation as criminals or a thieves' syndicate.\n\nIn reality, most Thistlefolk are gentle and vulnerable creatures who remain within the safety of the brambles to protect themselves from the larger predators that stalk the Sablewood in search of easy meals.\n\n---\n\n\n## Act One: The Merchant Cart – The Beginning\n\n### Scene Introduction\n\n**Read aloud to your player:**\n\n> _This evening, you finally made it to the Sablewood—a sprawling forest filled with colossal trees some say are even older than the Forgotten Gods. Sablewood is renowned for two things: its sunken trade routes, traveled by countless merchants, and its unique, hybrid animals. Even now, as you drive your carriage, strange sounds drift in: the low calls of lark-moths, the croak of lemur-toads, the scittering of a family of fox-bats in the underbrush._\n\n**Prompt to Player:**  \n_You are driving the carriage._\n\nAsk the player:\n\n> _You've noticed something unique about the look of the trees here in the Sablewood. What is it?_\n\n**GM Note:**  \nDescribe the trees as you pass, specifically incorporating the answer given by the player. (This utilizes the Daggerheart GM Principle: _Ask Questions and Incorporate the Answers._)\n\n---\n\n### The Overturned Cart\n\n**Read aloud:**\n\n> _As your steeds pull the carriage around a tight corner—one wheel briefly leaving the ground—you spot an overturned merchant's cart, lying sideways in the path and blocking your way forward. A scattering of fruits and vegetables litter the trail._\n>\n> _From around the side of the cart steps a strixwolf: a large creature with a wolf's body, an owl's face, and broad wings arching from its back. It finishes chewing its meal—the hand of a dead merchant—and fixes you with a curious gaze, clearly trying to judge whether you're friend or foe. Clumsily, two small pups follow, watching their mother and you with caution._\n>\n> _You pull back on the reins, bringing your carriage to a halt._\n\n**Ask:**  \n_What would you like to do?_\n\nGive the player a chance to roleplay and act. When you approach the merchant cart, proceed to the action roll.\n\n---\n\n### The First Action Roll\n\n**Read aloud:**\n\n> _The strixwolf is wary of your movement. Let's make our first roll to see how she reacts! This uses your **Presence** trait, so grab your Duality Dice and roll them, then add your Presence. If you wish, spend a Hope before the roll to add an Experience, if it applies. Then tell me your total, and which die came out higher!_\n\n#### Roll Results\n\n---\n\n**Success (10 or higher):**  \n- The strixwolf tries to keep her pups safe and remains calm.\n- If rolled with *Hope*: Tell the player to gain a Hope.\n- If rolled with *Fear*: Gain a Fear.\n- Introduce a consequence to keep the tension—move the narrative forward without undermining success.  \n\n  _Sample narration_:  \n  > _The mother strixwolf hoot-howls, perhaps calling another strixwolf from the trees. You sense you might not be alone for long._\n\n---\n\n**Failure (9 or below):**  \n- The strixwolf snarls and snaps at the approaching PC, upset by your presence.\n- If rolled with *Hope*: The player still gains a Hope. As GM, introduce a complication, but soften it compared to a full failure.\n\n  _Sample narration_:  \n  > _With a final snarl, she leans down to let her pups clamber onto her back, then takes off into the air, landing on a branch where she continues to watch your every move._\n\n- If rolled with *Fear*: Gain a Fear. The strixwolf's aggression causes the PC to mark a Stress.\n\n---\n\n**Critical Success (both dice the same number):**\n- Tell the player to mark a Hope. If you have any Stress, you may clear one.\n- The strixwolf approaches, head low and tail wagging, then sits calmly before the PC, showing cautious trust.\n\n---\n\n**GM Guidance:**  \nLet the player interpret and interact with these outcomes. Be sure to incorporate specific consequences or opportunities that flow naturally from your choices and the results of the first action roll.\n\n---\n\n\n## Thicket Thieves: Act Two, Part One — The Fallout\n\nLet the events of the previous act play out naturally, allowing the player to roleplay and take other actions. Use the following scenarios as guidance:\n\n---\n\n### SCENARIOS\n\n- **Searching the Merchant Cart**  \n  If the player decides to search the merchant cart, describe how it has been completely stripped of all valuables. The dead driver can be found with a mangled arm, clearly picked over by the strixwolf family for food.\n\n- **Inspecting the Body Further**  \n  If you choose to examine the body more closely, you may discover that the driver's neck was slit.\n\n- **Attacking the Strixwolf**  \n  If you attack the strixwolf, make an attack roll against a difficulty of 10. On a success, you deal damage using your weapon, and the pups will flee.\n\n- **Failed Interactions with the Strixwolf**  \n  If you fail any rolls to interact with the strixwolf, it pulls its pups onto its back and flies into a nearby tree, watching you from above.\n\n- **Searching for Clues**  \n  If you look for signs of something unusual, you spot the remnants of thorny bramble tangled around the carriage wheel and scattered along the road.\n\n- **Trying to Move On**  \n  If you attempt to move the merchant cart out of the way, try to get your own carriage moving again, or try to leave the trail, proceed to [Ambushed!](#the-ambush).\n\n---\n\n#### Strixwolf Mother *(Stat Block)*\n\n|  |  |\n|---|---|\n| **Tier:** 1 | **Standard Bite:** Melee, 1d6+3 phy |\n| **Attack Modifier:** +1 | **Difficulty:** 10 |\n| **Major Threshold:** 4 | **Severe Threshold:** 8 |\n| **HP:** OOO | **Stress:** OOO |\n\n---\n\n## The Ambush\n\nWhen the moment feels right, or if one of the above scenarios triggers it, ask the player to make an **Instinct Roll** with a difficulty of 14.\n\n- **On a Success:**  \n  You notice eyes watching you from the darkness beyond the trail.  \n  - If the roll was with *Fear*: Gain a Fear and have the player mark a Stress.  \n  - Use the [See Them Coming](#see-them-coming) prompts below.\n\n- **On a Failure:**  \n  You are immediately ambushed.  \n  - If the roll was with *Fear*: Gain a Fear and have the player also mark a Stress.  \n  - Use the [Ambushed!](#ambushed) prompts below.\n\n---\n\n### See Them Coming\n\n**Read aloud:**\n\n> \"You hear the sound of a branch snapping and turn to see two Thistlefolk sneaking through the underbrush, attempting to get the jump on you. The overturned cart was a distraction, but their plan didn't work. I'm going to set up a map!\"\n\n---\n\n### Ambushed!\n\n**Read aloud:**\n\n> \"In a whirlwind of cracking branches and unsheathed blades, a group of two Thistlefolk leap from the brush alongside the road. The overturned cart was an ambush! They stand before you, weapons drawn, blocking the road. They'll go first. I'm going to set up a battle map!\"\n\n---\n\n## Setting Up the Battle Map\n\n- Take the forest terrain you've prepared and ask the player to help spread it across the table to build the encounter map.\n- Encourage the player to add items from around the room to enrich the terrain, building the playspace together.\n- Place the overturned merchant cart on the table. Ask the player to place their miniature nearby, along with their carriage, where you imagine yourself to be in the scene.\n- Finally, place **one Thistlefolk Ambusher** and **one Thistlefolk Thief** standee in **Close** range of the player.\n\n---\n\n## Beginning the Encounter\n\nOn the following page, you'll find the stat blocks for the Ambusher and Thief. Use them to guide the remainder of this encounter.\n\n**GM Tips:**\n- Make the battle your own! Decide in detail what the Thistlefolk look like, and describe the scene vividly, as if it's unfolding in a movie or story.\n- Invite your player to participate in creating the scene:  \n  - Ask them to describe their attacks or evasive maneuvers in detail.  \n  - Prompt them for unique visual elements: What distinctive clothing do the Ambushers wear? What is unique about their fighting style?\n  - Discuss with your player what level of violence you're comfortable with. Are you aiming to kill the Thistlefolk, incapacitate, or knock them out?\n\n---\n\n\n## Act Two: Thicket Thieves – Part Two – The First Encounter\n\n### Ambushed!\n\nIf the player was ambushed, the Thistlefolk act first. This is reflected in the Thistlefolk Ambusher's feature, **Ambush**.\n\n**Read Aloud:**\n\n> \"Having the upper hand, the Thistlefolk Ambusher rushes you! Because of their Ambush feature, they get to make an attack immediately. This only happens when they enter the scene, so it won't be like this every time. But right now, they are slashing at you with a dagger, protected by armor made of polished stones.\"\n\n- Move the Ambusher into melee with the player character.\n- Then, follow the attack guide (below) for the Ambusher.\n\n---\n\n### See Them Coming\n\nIf the player spotted the Ambushers before the attack, you get to act first.\n\n**Read Aloud:**\n\n> \"You stand at the ready, having spotted the Thistlefolk before they could ambush you! You get to act first.\"\n\n---\n\n### Thistlefolk Tactics and Goals\n\n- **Goal:** Use the Ambusher to keep the player's attention while the Thief attempts to steal your carriage.\n\n---\n\n### Using Reference Stat Blocks\n\n- The Thistlefolk Ambusher stat block below represents a single adversary for this solo encounter.\n- For larger groups, Daggerheart uses \"Reference\" stat blocks to represent multiple adversaries with identical stats.\n\n---\n\n### Ambusher Attack Guide\n\nWhen you make an attack against a PC:\n1. Roll a d20 and add the Ambusher's attack modifier (**+1**).\n2. Compare this to the PC's **Evasion**.\n    - If the attack hits, roll damage using **1d8+5**.\n    - Ask the player to compare the total to your damage thresholds, use armor if you'd like, and mark your hit point(s) accordingly.\n\n---\n\n### Thief Attack Guide\n\nWhen you make an attack against a PC with the Thistlefolk Thief:\n1. Roll a d20 and add the Thief's attack modifier (**+3**).\n2. Compare this to the PC's **Evasion**.\n    - If the attack hits, roll damage using **2d4+3**.\n    - Have the player compare the total to your damage thresholds, use armor if you'd like, and mark your hit point(s).\n    - If the Thief is using **Back Off**, and the attack succeeds, deal the listed damage and move the player's standee in a direction of your choice—into **Far** range from where you were.\n\n---\n\n### Ambusher/Thief Defense Guide\n\n- When an adversary (Ambusher or Thief) is hit with damage, compare the amount to their thresholds and mark appropriate hit points.\n- When the last hit point is marked, that adversary is defeated.\n\n---\n\n\n## Thistlefolk Stat Blocks\n\n### Thistlefolk Ambusher\n\n- **Tier:** 1 (Standard)\n- **Weapon:** Dagger (Melee) — *1d8+5 Physical*\n- **Attack Modifier:** +1\n- **Difficulty:** 13\n- **Damage Thresholds:** Minor: 6 | Major: 12\n- **HP:** 3\n- **Stress:** 2\n\n**Features:**\n\n- **Ambush (Reaction):**\n    - *Trigger:* When the Ambusher enters the scene without being spotted first.\n    - *Effect:* Immediately moves into Melee with a target and makes an attack. On a success, deals **2d4+8 physical damage** with their dagger.\n\n---\n\n### Thistlefolk Thief\n\n- **Tier:** 1 (Leader)\n- **Weapon:** Serrated Blade (Melee) — *2d4+3 Physical*\n- **Attack Modifier:** +3\n- **Difficulty:** 14\n- **Damage Thresholds:** Minor: 7 | Major: 14\n- **HP:** 4\n- **Stress:** 2\n\n**Features:**\n\n- **Back Off (Action):**\n    - *Cost:* Spend a Fear\n    - *Effect:* Make an attack roll against **all** targets within Melee range. Any targets hit are blasted backwards, taking **2d6+3 magic damage** and are pushed into **Far** range.\n\n---\n\n## The Encounter's End\n\nThe encounter concludes when **all adversaries are defeated**. Clean up the map, then encourage the player to **describe a montage of the remaining travel time to Hush**.\n\n---\n\n## Act Three: Seeking an Arcanist\n\n### Arrival in Hush\n\n**Read the following aloud:**\n\n> The path leads you further into the forest until you spot a large stone pillar, carved top to bottom in ancient dwarven symbols. This denotes one corner of the peaceful village of Hush. When you pass beyond the stone marker, you feel a small sensation like the pop of a bubble, then the sounds of friendly chatter become louder. Though the trees of the Sablewood are unchanged here, there is a distinctive safe and comforting air.  \n>  \n> A few smiling faces turn to you as your carriage rolls in, waving or casting a warm greeting toward you. There is lively music drifting your direction from the tavern at the center of town.  \n>\n> You know you need to find the Whitefire Arcanist to deliver the package from the King.  \n>  \n> What would you like to do?\n\n---\n\n### Interacting with the Locals\n\nIf the player would like to talk to an NPC, consider introducing one of the following:\n\n**NPC Options**\n\n- **Fidget**  \n  _Wildborne Human (they/them)_  \n  A young child who will not stop wiggling—it's clear how they earned their name. They are often busy scurrying up the trees in town, lighting lanterns that hang from the branches. Fidget knows the fastest ways through the village. If you approach, they are curious about what life is like outside Hush.\n\n- **Lausa Standworth**  \n  _Wildborne Dwarf (she/her)_  \n  An older woman with a thick beard, carrying a barrel of ale (which she will keep on her shoulder the entire time). If you approach, she wants to know the name of your weapon and the date it was forged.\n\n- **Halython Fives**  \n  _Loreborne Clank (he/him)_  \n  A soft-spoken clank (a humanoid robot) of indeterminate age. His metallic shoulder bears scratches where an alert but friendly fox-bat rests. He is playing an unknown game that uses cards and acorns. If you approach, he is curious about the Thistlefolk and asks if you encountered any on your way.\n\nDuring the conversation, introduce a second NPC from the list above. The second NPC will be a friend who knows where the Whitefire Arcanist lives. They last saw her at the tavern and will send you in that direction.\n\n_Example progression_: You might meet Fidget in town. After some conversation and coaxing, Fidget points you to the tavern to meet Lausa.\n\n---\n\n### The Clover Tavern\n\n**Read the following aloud:**\n\n> The Clover Tavern is a sight to behold, with six curving stories climbing the trunk of an ancient tree. This is the heart of the community, always crowded with music and good-natured conversation.\n>\n> Newcomers to the bar must take off their shoes and hang them over a line that stretches across the bar's ground floor. Inevitably, by the time visitors leave, their shoes will be shined and filled with small trinkets.\n>\n> As you enter, what would you like to do?\n\nLet the player roleplay—introduce a barkeep or friendly local who invites you to participate in the shoe tradition. Encourage you to explore different levels of the tavern.\n\nConsider asking the player to describe details about the tavern, such as:\n\n- How does the second floor differ from the first?\n- What smells permeate the air?\n- What unique customs do locals perform when anyone enters a room?\n\n---\n\n### Optional: The Firstmoss Festival\n\nIf the player inquires, you will find out that Hush is currently celebrating the **Firstmoss Festival**—the time when new crops in the Sunless Farms have developed their first layer of moss, signaling the start of ripening for the season.\n\nIt's a celebration of spring's arrival and the abundance of fresh fruits and vegetables soon to come.\n\n**Festival Activities Might Include:**\n\n- Arm wrestling competition\n- Stone-painting class\n- A small marketplace of homemade trinkets\n\n---\n\n### Finding the Whitefire Arcanist\n\nWhen you're ready, guide the player to interact with an NPC who can help you reach the Arcanist. If you skip asking anyone in town, simply use one of the NPCs described above.\n\nAfter a few exchanges, the NPC can share:\n\n> \"The Arcanist is quite busy, but if you've traveled so far, I'm sure she'll be more than hospitable. We would be lost without her. She keeps this whole place protected by a powerful ward so that no dangers from the Sablewood can pass into town.\n>\n> \"You'll find her house to the south, through the farmland. It's hanging from one of the old Sablewood trees—you can't miss it.\"\n\nWhen the player is ready, send them off towards the Arcanist's home.\n\n---\n\n\n---\n\n## ACT FOUR: The Treehouse of the Whitefire Arcanist\n\n### Arrival at the Arcanist's Treehouse\n\n**Read the following aloud:**\n\n> Making your way past the homes of the village and through the farmlands of Hush, you see a variety of crops beginning to sprout a thin layer of glowing blue moss over their fruits and vegetables. The moss pulses softly, like a heartbeat, as you pass.\n>\n> Among the thriving groves, the Sablewood trees stand tall, each carved with hundreds of unique faces, their eyes peering in every direction. One tree, taller than the rest, holds the Arcanist's home, dangling like an overripe fruit. The home itself is suspended by a braid of rope as thick as a giant's forearm, tied to a massive branch and counterweighted by a cabin-sized boulder lying at the tree's base. Symbols mark the stone, and the cabin's windows flicker with a soft yellow-green light.\n>\n> What would you like to do?\n\n---\n\n### Exploring and Approaching the Treehouse\n\nAllow the player a moment to roleplay, encouraging problem-solving and creative approaches. You may use or adapt the guidance below:\n\n- **Calling Up:** If the player tries to call to the Arcanist from below, there is no response, but the light inside continues to flicker.\n- **Cutting the Rope:** If you attempt to cut the counterweight rope, a burst of magical force blasts you backwards a few feet, causing you to suffer 1 Stress.\n- **Climbing the Tree:** If the player attempts to climb, require an **Agility Roll** (Difficulty 13). On a failure, a tree limb gently picks you up, sets you safely on the forest floor, and resumes its original form.\n\nLet the player experiment until they succeed in getting the Arcanist's attention.\n\n---\n\n### Meeting the Whitefire Arcanist\n\nWhen you finally earn the Arcanist's attention, describe her with the following:\n\n> Emanating from the home comes a seven-foot-tall blend of humanoid and firefly: the Whitefire Arcanist herself. She's a faerie who moves with an uncanny mix of deliberate slowness and sudden, jerky motions. Her facial expressions are subtle, but her voice is full of clear emotion. Though old, she is spry and eyes you mischievously.\n>\n> \"Are you the one Emeris sent from the capital? Oh my, you're rather late, aren't you? Come in, come in.\"\n\nAs she lowers her home and invites you inside, describe the interior:\n\n- The main room is crowded with potion bottles, spellbooks, runes, plants, and a menagerie of small creatures.\n- Despite the chaos, not a single thing is out of place; it's clear that even moving an item an inch would be noticed instantly by the Arcanist.\n\n---\n\n### The Package from King Emeris\n\nLet the player freely roleplay. The Arcanist is curious about:\n\n- Your journey so far\n- The NPC who directed you here\n- (Playfully) How you imagine you will someday die\n\nWhenever conversation winds down, the Arcanist asks after the package from King Emeris.\n\n> To inspect it safely, she magically unfolds her home like a blossoming flower. She urges you to quickly bring the crate inside before the cabin closes up again, now a shade larger than before.\n\n**Read aloud as she opens the delivery:**\n\n> Inside King Emeris' package lies a massive stone with a lion's face carved into it. Marlowe, you recognize it immediately: the keystone from the capital city gate's main archway.\n>\n> The Arcanist nods sagely. “Of course the King would keep this delivery secret. If anyone knew your city was no longer warded, you would be conquered before sunrise.”\n>\n> With a serious tone, she begins to ready her unusual home for travel again. “We must travel to the Open Vale to revitalize the ward. Such an effort of magic will attract dangerous creatures from the dark reaches of the Sablewood. I'll need your help.”\n\n---\n\n### Transition to Act Five\n\nIf the player is eager to assist, proceed directly to **The Open Vale** (Act Five). If they wish, allow them to describe your experiences traveling alongside the eccentric, enigmatic Whitefire Arcanist.\n\n---\n\n\n\n## Act Five: The Ward Renewal  \n### Part One: The Open Vale\n\n**Read aloud:**  \nOn the Arcanist's instructions, your carriage arrives in a mysterious clearing—an almost perfect circle—the only spot in the Sablewood without trees crowding out the sky. This is **The Open Vale**.\n\n> The Arcanist appears thoughtful as she surveys the clearing.  \n>  \n> \"This place,\" she says, \"has always been used for powerful ritual magic. It's here that I first forged the ward pillars found at the four corners of Hush, the ones that keep your village safe to this day. I nearly died performing that ritual.\"\n>\n> She seems ready to share more, but stops herself, perhaps uneasy about offending the Forgotten Gods.\n\nInvite the player to interact and speak with the Arcanist. Let them ask questions and explore her mood or the location. When you are ready to move the story forward, read the following:\n\nThe Arcanist's antennae twitch in a strange, almost startling manner.  \n> “This is good. Stop, stop. Yes, here. Now come help me, I'm old.”\n\n\nShe unfolds the carriage (just as she did with her home) and stands over the crate, humming softly. Her body brightens, flickering with light in the night air.\n\n> “I'll need about an hour to prepare. Please, enjoy the night air while you can—we will be quite busy soon.”\n\n---\n\n### Adversary Reference: Ancient Skeleton\n\n**Ancient Skeleton**  \n*Tier 1 Standard*  \n\n- **Weapon:** Rusted Sword (Melee, 1d6+1 physical damage)  \n- **Attack Modifier:** +0  \n- **Difficulty:** 12  \n- **Thresholds:** 7/none  \n- **HP:** 2  \n- **Stress:** 1  \n\n**Features:**  \n- **Group Attack (Action):**  \n    - Spend a Fear to select a target.  \n    - Spotlight all Ancient Skeletons within Close range of that target.  \n    - All those skeletons move to Melee range of the target and make one combined attack roll.  \n    - On a success, each deals 4 physical damage (combine total damage as appropriate).\n\n---\n\n\n\n## Act Five: The Ward Renewal  \n### Part Two: The Ritual Begins\n\n---\n\n### Opening Scene\n\n**Read aloud:**  \nThe Arcanist lets out a shrill cry:  \n> “The keystone has finally responded! Quickly, surround me, the ritual must begin or I'll lose the pathway! Hurry!”\n\nHer body begins to glow, ever brighter, as her eyes roll back into her head. The entire carriage lifts a foot off the ground. Unnatural screeches echo through the woods as creatures sense the surge of arcane energy.\n\n---\n\nArrange the scene as follows:\n- Place the Whitefire Arcanist standee at the center of the table.\n- Have the player place their character standee in the scene.\n- Place **two Ancient Skeletons** within *close* range of the Arcanist.\n- Place **one Forest Wraith** within *far* range.\n\n**Read aloud:**  \nYou feel a tremor as two ancient skeletons claw their way from beneath the earth, rusted swords in hand—disturbed by the magic the Arcanist wields. In the distance, a Forest Wraith floats toward you, silent but menacing.\n\n---\n\n### The Ritual Countdown\n\nTo guide the encounter:\n\n- Take a d6 and set it on the table with the **4** facing up.  \n- **This is the ritual's countdown die.**  \n    - **Tick down** the die by 1 whenever an adversary is defeated.\n    - **Tick up** the die by 1 each time the Whitefire Arcanist is hit by an attack.\n- **Goal:** Defend the Arcanist until the countdown reaches **0**. When this happens, the ritual is complete and combat ends.\n\n---\n\n### Environmental Feature: Vengeance of the Vale\n\n#### The Open Vale  \n- **Tier:** 1  \n- **Type:** Exploration\n\n**Feature: Vengeance of the Vale**  \n- *Action*: Spend a Fear to summon one additional Ancient Skeleton from the ground within **very close range** of a PC.\n\n> *Note to GM: Environments can offer unique features. Use this one to add challenge or urgency to the encounter when needed.*\n\n---\n\n### Encounter Guidance for the GM\n\n- The ritual countdown only ticks down when adversaries are defeated.  \n    - If progress stalls, use **Vengeance of the Vale** to introduce more skeletons—the player should be able to defeat them easily.\n- Have adversaries focus attacks on the Whitefire Arcanist if the player is not within range.\n    - Her **Difficulty** is 11.  \n    - The Arcanist does **not** track HP or Stress; damage to her is narrative only.\n- Keep up pacing and danger, but remember the Arcanist's survival is crucial.\n\n---\n\n### Forest Wraith Battle Guide\n\n- **Attack:** Far range, **+3** attack modifier.\n    - On a hit, deals **2d6+8 magic damage**.\n    - **Resistance:** Physical damage taken is halved (rounded up).\n- **Memory Delve:** Makes target **Vulnerable** (*all rolls against them have advantage until their next rest*—this condition does **not** stack).\n- **Pass-Through:** Use this power sparingly, as it incapacitates the player. If the player becomes **Untethered**, they can't act until an adversary is defeated (i.e., countdown ticks down).  \n    - If the player is Untethered, they mark 2 HP and their soul returns.\n\n*Tip: Use Vengeance of the Vale to create weak skeletons for quick victories if the player becomes Untethered.*\n\n---\n\n#### Forest Wraith\n\n- **Tier:** 1 (Bruisers)\n- **Lifedrain:** Far, 2d6+8 magic\n- **Attack Modifier:** +3\n- **Difficulty:** 13\n- **Major:** 7 | **Severe:** 14\n- **HP:** 6\n- **Stress:** 3\n\n**Features:**\n- **Spectral Body (Passive):** Resistance to physical damage.\n- **Memory Delve (Action):** Attack a close target. On success, flies to Melee, places hand on target's cheek; ask the player to describe a terrifying childhood moment. Deal 3d4+9 magic damage and make them Vulnerable until next rest.\n- **Pass-Through (Action):** Spend a Fear, attack a Melee target. On success, the Wraith passes through and temporarily untethers the target's soul (see above for handling Untethered player).\n\n---\n\n### Death Move\n\n- If the player marks their last hit point, they trigger a **Death Move**:  \n    - For this adventure, they fall unconscious until healed or the threat passes.\n\n---\n\n### Ending the Ritual\n\nWhen the ritual die reaches **0**, the ritual concludes. Proceed to the Epilogue.\n\n---\n\n\n## Beyond the Vale: Epilogue\n\n### The Keystone Ward\n\n#### Read Aloud:\n\nAs you deliver a powerful blow, the ritual ends! The carriage crashes to the ground as the keystone vibrates with arcane energy. Then, all at once, a soundless explosion bursts from the Whitefire Arcanist, scattering the last remnants of any enemies. The clearing falls silent.\n\n---\n\nShortly after, you return inside the cozy treehouse. The keystone now hangs carefully suspended over a rumbling fire in the hearth. The Arcanist, looking even older than before, sits cross-legged in an overstuffed chair. There is a deep exhaustion in her voice as she addresses you:\n\n> “You fought hard. I'm not surprised, of course. The King keeps good company. I'm very glad you were there.”\n\n---\n\n#### Wrapping Up\n\nGive the player space to speak with the Arcanist, resolve personal moments, or ask final questions. When conversation slows or the player inquires about the keystone, continue with:\n\n> “The keystone will need a week, maybe more, to allow the magic to settle. I'll need to watch it carefully—make sure nothing cracks, or becomes sentient or anything of the like. You know how it is.  \n>  \n> And in the meantime, after you rest and gather yourselves, have a nice hot meal and warm bath, I have one more thing to ask of you.”\n\n---\n\n#### A Glimpse Beyond\n\nZoom out from the Arcanist's home, rising above the forest's canopy. Stone spires twist through the treeline, each bearing a flickering flame—beacons against the shadows.\n\nThe Arcanist continues:\n\n> “There's a Spire, just west of here, maybe a few hours walk. I sensed its power on the way to the ritual, but it felt… strange. The light was weaker than it should be.  \n>  \n> I fear something is terribly wrong with the Spirekeeper. And if its fire goes out entirely, I dread what might follow.  \n>  \n> When you're ready, come back and I'll give you my map so you can make it there safely. It's good to have a hero in the Sablewood again.\"\n\n---\n\n**This concludes today's session.**\n</campaign_material>\n\n<player_character>\n# Sorcerer — Arcana & Midnight\n\n**Name:** Marlowe Fairwind  \n**Pronouns:** She/Her  \n**Heritage:** Loeborne Elf  \n**Subclass:** Primal Origin  \n**Level:** 1\n\n---\n\n## Stats\n\n- **Agility:** 0 (Sprint, Leap, Maneuver)\n- **Strength:** -1 (Lift, Smash, Grapple)\n- **Finesse:** +1 (Control, Hide, Tinker)\n- **Instinct:** +2 (Perceive, Sense, Navigate)\n- **Presence:** +1 (Charm, Perform, Deceive)\n- **Knowledge:** 0 (Recall, Analyze, Comprehend)\n\n**Evasion:** 10  \n**Armor:** 3\n\n---\n\n## Damage & Health\n\n- **Minor Damage:** 7 (Mark 1 HP)\n- **Major Damage:** 14 (Mark 2 HP)\n- **Severe Damage:** — (Mark 3 HP)\n\n**HP:**  \n`[ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ]`\n\n**Stress:**  \n`[ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ]`\n\n---\n\n## Hope\n\n*Spend a Hope to use an experience or help an ally.*\n\n**Volatile Magic:** Spend 3 Hope to reroll any number of your damage dice on an attack that deals magic damage.\n\nHope track: `[ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ]`\n\n---\n\n## Experience\n\n- **Royal Mage:** +2  \n- **Not On My Watch:** +2\n\n---\n\n## Gold\n\nHandfuls: `oooooooooooo`  \nBags: `oooooo`  \nChest: `o`\n\n---\n\n# Class Feature\n\n## Arcane Sense\nYou can sense the presence of magical people and objects within Close range.\n\n## Minor Illusion\nMake a Spellcast Roll (10).

A scattering of fruits and vegetables litter the trail.\n\nFrom around the side of the cart steps a strixwolf: a large creature with a wolf's body, an owl's face, and broad wings arching from its back. It finishes chewing its meal—the hand of a dead merchant—and fixes you with a curious gaze, clearly trying to judge whether you're friend or foe. Clumsily, two small pups follow, watching their mother and you with caution.\n\nYou pull back on the reins, bringing your carriage to a halt.\n\nWhat do you do?\n"
