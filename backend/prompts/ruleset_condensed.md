# Daggerheart Ruleset (Condensed Reference)

> This is an unofficial, reorganized reference that restates the rules of **Daggerheart** in my own words, based on the Daggerheart SRD and related online materials. For the full official text, examples, and license terms, always refer to the Daggerheart SRD and the Darrington Press Community Gaming License. ([Daggerheart][1])

---

## 1. What Daggerheart Is

Daggerheart is a fantasy tabletop role‑playing game for **1 Game Master (GM)** and **2–5 players**. Each player controls a **Player Character (PC)**; the GM portrays the world, its dangers, and all other characters.

When the outcome of a character's action is uncertain, you roll a pair of twelve‑sided dice called **Duality Dice**: one die for **Hope**, one for **Fear**. Their total and which die is higher determine success, failure, and whether Hope or Fear grows at the table.

## 2. Characters

During character creation, you can fill in your character's **name, pronouns, and description** at **any point**; you don't have to decide them before choosing mechanics.

Each PC is defined by:

* **Class & Subclass**
* **Heritage** (Ancestry + Community)
* **Traits** and **Proficiency**
* **Background**
* **Experiences**
* **Hit Points, Stress, Evasion, Hope**
* **Weapons, armor, items**
* **Domain cards (magic, techniques, abilities)**
* **Connections** to other PCs

### 2.1 Classes & Subclasses

A **Class** is your broad adventuring role. It determines:

* Which **two Domains** you can draw domain cards from
* Starting **Evasion** and **Hit Points**
* Your starting **equipment options**
* One or more **class features**
* A **Class Hope Feature** (a powerful ability that costs 3 Hope)
* Level‑up options and subclass paths

The core SRD includes 9 classes:

* **Bard** – Supportive performer and leader (Domains: *Codex & Grace*)
* **Druid** – Nature shifter and spellcaster (*Arcana & Sage*)
* **Guardian** – Defensive front‑liner (*Blade & Valor*)
* **Ranger** – Scout and hunter, often with a companion (*Bone & Sage*)
* **Rogue** – Sneaky specialist (*Grace & Midnight*)
* **Seraph** – Holy champion (*Splendor & Valor*)
* **Sorcerer** – Innate spellcaster (*Arcana & Midnight*)
* **Warrior** – Weapon master (*Blade & Bone*)
* **Wizard** – Learned mage (*Codex & Splendor*)

Each class has **two subclasses**. Your subclass:

* Sets your **Spellcast trait** (if any)
* Grants a **Foundation feature** at level 1
* Offers **Specialization** and **Mastery** features at higher levels

> Example: The Bard's class feature, *Rally*, grants “Rally Dice” that allies can spend to boost rolls or clear Stress.

**During character creation:**

1. **Choose 1 class** from the list above.
2. Take that class's **character sheet** and **character guide**.
3. Apply your class's **starting class feature(s)** (usually printed near the bottom left of the class sheet). If a feature requires a choice, **make that choice now**.
4. Choose **1 subclass** for your class.
5. Take that subclass's **Foundation card** and apply its listed features.

### 2.2 Heritage: Ancestry & Community

Your **heritage** is a combination of:

1. **Ancestry** – Species/lineage; grants physical traits and **two ancestry features**.
2. **Community** – The culture/environment that raised you; grants a **community feature**.

At character creation:

* Choose **1 Ancestry card** and **1 Community card**.
* Record both under **“Heritage”** on your character sheet.
* Gain that ancestry's **two ancestry features** and that community's **community feature**, as listed on the cards.

The SRD lists ancestries such as:
**Clank, Drakona, Dwarf, Elf, Faerie, Faun, Firbolg, Fungril, Galapa, Giant, Goblin, Halfling, Human, Infernis, Katari, Orc, Ribbet, Simiah**. ([Daggerheart SRD][2])

#### Mixed Ancestry

Instead of choosing only one ancestry, you can create a **Mixed Ancestry**:

* Choose **Ancestry A** and **Ancestry B**.
* From Ancestry A, take the **top (1st‑listed) ancestry feature**.
* From Ancestry B, take the **bottom (2nd‑listed) ancestry feature**.

You still record a single Heritage on your sheet, but note both ancestries in that entry.

#### Communities

Communities include:
**Highborne, Loreborne, Orderborne, Ridgeborne, Seaborne, Slyborne, Underborne, Wanderborne, Wildborne**. ([Daggerheart SRD][2])

Choose 1 Community card, gain its **community feature**, and record it alongside your ancestry as part of your Heritage.

### 2.3 Traits

Every character has six **Traits**, representing physical, mental, and social aptitude:

* **Agility** – Speed, acrobatics, movement, dodging
* **Strength** – Power, lifting, feats of might
* **Finesse** – Precision, stealth, delicate work
* **Instinct** – Perception, intuition, navigation
* **Presence** – Charm, force of personality
* **Knowledge** – Learning, analysis, problem‑solving

At character creation, assign these **modifiers** in any order:

> **+2, +1, +1, +0, +0, −1**

Whenever you **roll with a trait**, you add its modifier to your action roll total.
Record each trait's modifier on your character sheet.

### 2.4 Proficiency

**Proficiency** measures your skill with weapons and some other tasks:

* At level 1, your Proficiency is **1**; write **1** in the **Proficiency** field on your character sheet.
* Proficiency usually determines **how many damage dice** you roll with a weapon
  (e.g., Proficiency 2 with a `d8+2` weapon → roll **`2d8+2`**).
* **Proficiency increases the number of dice**, not the flat bonus: a `d6+1` weapon with Proficiency 1 is `1d6+1`; with Proficiency 2 it's `2d6+1`, and so on.
* Proficiency increases at **levels 2, 5, and 8** via tier achievements.

### 2.5 Core Resources: HP, Stress, Evasion, Hope

At the end of character creation, you record your starting resources:

* **Level** – All PCs start at **level 1**. Record **Level 1** at the top of your character sheet.
* **Hit Points (HP)** – Abstract physical health; set by class. Your class sheet gives your starting HP; **record that value** on your character sheet. When you take enough damage, you **mark HP boxes** instead of tracking exact numbers.
* **Stress** – Tracks mental, emotional, and physical strain. All PCs begin with **6 Stress slots**; **mark 6 empty Stress boxes** on your sheet.
* **Evasion** – How hard you are to hit; most attack rolls against you compare to your Evasion.

  * At character creation, find the value printed **directly beneath the Evasion field** on your class sheet and **copy that number** into the Evasion field on your character sheet.
  * Features and conditions can later modify your Evasion.
* **Hope** – A shared metacurrency for PC abilities. Each PC starts with **2 Hope** and can hold up to 6 at once; **mark 2 Hope** in the Hope field.

#### 2.5.1 Damage Thresholds

Armor and level combine to give each PC two damage thresholds: **Major** and **Severe**.

When you take **incoming damage** (after reductions like armor, resistance, etc.):

* If damage ≥ Severe threshold → **mark 3 HP**
* If damage ≥ Major but < Severe → **mark 2 HP**
* If damage < Major but > 0 → **mark 1 HP**
* If damage is reduced to 0 or less → **mark no HP**

Optional rule: Taking damage equal to **twice** your Severe threshold can mark **4 HP**.

If you **mark your last HP**, you **fall** and must choose a **death move** (see §7).

#### 2.5.2 Stress

Stress represents psychological wear and tear or strenuous effort:

* Various effects cause you to **mark Stress**.
* If you must mark Stress but have no empty Stress box, mark **1 HP** instead.
* If all Stress boxes are marked, you gain the **Vulnerable** condition until at least 1 Stress is cleared.
* You cannot use moves that *require* you to mark Stress if you have no free Stress boxes.

Stress is usually cleared by **rests**, **downtime moves**, or features.

### 2.6 Weapons, Armor, Items

#### 2.6.1 Weapons & Proficiency

At level 1, choose your starting weapons from the **Tier 1 Weapon tables**:

* Choose **one** of:

  * **One two‑handed primary weapon**, **or**
  * **One one‑handed primary weapon and one one‑handed secondary weapon**.

Record your choice in the **Active Weapon** field(s) on your character sheet.

Each weapon lists:

* The **trait** used for attacks (often Strength, Finesse, or Agility)
* **Range** (Melee, Very Close, Close, Far, Very Far)
* Its **damage dice** (e.g., `d6+1`, `d8+2`)
* Any special properties or features

Your **Proficiency** sets how many damage dice you roll:

* Proficiency 1 with a `d6+1` weapon → roll **`1d6+1`**.
* Proficiency 2 with a `d8+2` weapon → roll **`2d8+2`**.
* Proficiency affects **how many damage dice you roll**, **not** the flat bonus.

#### 2.6.2 Armor, Thresholds & Armor Score

At level 1, choose **1 set of armor** from the **Tier 1 Armor table** and record it in the **Active Armor** field.

Armor provides:

* A **Base Armor Score**
* **Base damage thresholds** (two numbers, usually labeled **Major** and **Severe**)
* A limited number of **Armor Slots** (marking these reduces incoming damage; details depend on the armor)

To determine your thresholds at character creation:

1. Take the armor's **Base Thresholds**.
2. Add your **character level** to each (so at level 1, add **+1** to both).
3. Record the resulting **Major** and **Severe** thresholds on your sheet.

Your **Armor Score** is:

> **Armor Score = equipped armor's Base Score + any permanent bonuses**
> from abilities, features, or other lasting effects.

Record this total in the **Armor Score** field (top left of your sheet).

You may only have **one set of Active Armor** equipped at a time.
Your **Active Weapon** entry holds either a single two‑handed weapon or a one‑handed primary plus a one‑handed secondary; other weapons you carry are considered backup gear.

#### 2.6.3 Starting Inventory

In addition to weapons and armor, at character creation add the following to your **Inventory**:

* **Standard gear**

  * 1 torch
  * 50 feet of rope
  * Basic supplies
  * A handful of gold
    *Mark **one box** in “Gold ➝ Handfuls” on the left‑hand column of your sheet.*

* **Choose 1 potion**

  * **Minor Health Potion** – when used, clear **1d4 HP**, **or**
  * **Minor Stamina Potion** – when used, clear **1d4 Stress**.

* **Class items**

  * **One class‑specific item** from your character guide.
  * If applicable, the **class‑specific item used to carry your spells** (such as a grimoire, focus, or holy symbol).

* **Optional items**

  * Any other **GM‑approved items** you want at the start of play.

Your class sheet and character guide may refine or expand these starting options; if there's ever a conflict, use the printed class/ancestry/community/domain cards as the final say.

### 2.7 Experiences

An **Experience** is a short phrase that captures a specific skill set, background, or knack your character has.

* At level 1 you choose **two Experiences**, each with a **+2 modifier**.
* Experiences should be **specific but flexible** (“Streetwise Informant”) rather than universal (“Good at Everything” or “Highly Skilled”).
* Experiences **do not grant specific mechanical powers by themselves**—they shouldn't be things like “Supersonic Flight” or “Invulnerable.”
* You gain additional Experiences at **levels 2, 5, and 8**, each starting at +2.

When your PC **makes a move** or any other important roll, you can **spend 1 Hope** to **Utilize an Experience**:

* Choose **one relevant Experience** and **add its modifier** to that action roll's total.

This is the primary mechanical use of Experiences; on their own they are descriptive, not always‑on bonuses.

### 2.8 Domains & Domain Cards

**Domains** are themed decks of cards that provide spells, abilities, and magical grimoires. The SRD defines **nine Domains**, such as Arcana, Blade, Bone, Codex, Grace, Midnight, Sage, Splendor, and Valor, each with a distinct fantasy flavor.

Each **domain card** includes:

* **Level** (1–10; you may only take cards at or below your level)
* **Domain icon** (must be one of your class's two domains)
* **Recall Cost** (Stress you pay to swap this card from vault into loadout mid‑adventure)
* **Type** (Ability, Spell, or Grimoire)
* Name and rules text for its features

#### Loadout & Vault

* Your **loadout** is up to **5 domain cards** currently ready for use.
* Any additional cards you own are stored in your **vault**.
* During downtime, you can freely rearrange which 5 cards are in your loadout.
* During adventures, you may pay each card's **Recall Cost** (Stress) to swap it with another card of the same domain and level from your vault.

At character creation:

* Each class has access to **2 of the 9 Domains** in the core set (listed on your class sheet).
* Choose **2 level‑1 Domain cards** from those allowed Domains:

  * Either **1 card from each Domain**, or
  * **2 cards from a single Domain**.
* Take those cards and apply their rules.

### 2.9 Connections

**Connections** define relationships between the PCs.

A simple Session 0 procedure:

1. **Description round**

   * Each player briefly describes their PC to the group:

     * Name, pronouns, character description
     * Their Experiences
     * Key answers to the background questions in their character guide

2. **Discussion**

   * Use the **“Connections”** section of your character guide as inspiration.
   * Discuss possible relationships between PCs (old friendships, debts, rivalries, shared history, etc.).

3. **Propose connections**

   * Each player suggests **at least one connection** between their character and **each other PC**.
   * Other players may **accept or reject** any suggested connection.

4. **Consent & flexibility**

   * A player may reject a proposed connection **for any reason**.
   * It is **not required** for every pair of PCs to have a pre‑established connection.
   * Additional connections can be **discovered and developed during play**.

You don't need to phrase Connections in mechanical terms—they're story hooks the GM and players can call on later.

### 2.10 Background & Backstory

Your **background** is the story of who your character was before the campaign begins.

* During character creation, answer the **background questions** in your character guide.
* You may **modify or replace** these questions to better fit your character concept.
* **Mechanical rule:** Your background has **no explicit mechanical effect**—it doesn't directly grant bonuses, Experiences, or abilities.

As you flesh out your background, you're free to **adjust earlier choices** (class details, heritage, traits, etc.) so the mechanics better reflect the story you're telling.

---

## 3. Core Gameplay & Spotlight

### 3.1 Core Loop

The game's core loop works like this:

1. **Set the Scene** – The GM describes where you are, what's happening, and any immediate threats or opportunities.
2. **Ask & Answer Questions** – Players ask about the environment and details; the GM answers (and can ask questions back) to collaboratively build out the fiction.
3. **Act & Resolve** – Players describe what their characters do. If an action is risky or uncertain, the GM calls for a roll. The results change the fiction.
4. **Repeat** – The scene continues until natural closure or a mechanical trigger (like a rest, countdown reaching 0, or scene‑ending ability).

### 3.2 Spotlight & Turn Flow

Daggerheart does **not** use fixed initiative or fixed “actions per turn.” Instead, it uses the **spotlight**, an informal token representing whose character currently drives the scene.

* Whoever currently has the spotlight describes what their character does.
* After that move resolves, the spotlight passes to:

  * Whoever the fiction naturally focuses on,
  * Someone who hasn't acted in a while, or
  * Whoever a mechanical trigger specifies (for example, some GM moves or adversary features).

**Optional Spotlight Tracker:** Groups who prefer a more “turn‑based” feel can give each player a few tokens per scene (e.g., 3). Each time a player has the spotlight, they spend a token. When everyone runs out, everyone refills for the next cycle.

---

## 4. Rolls & Duality Dice

### 4.1 When to Roll

You **only roll** when:

* The outcome of a move is **uncertain**, and
* Failure would be interesting or consequential.

If success is trivial or failure would be dull, the GM simply describes success.

### 4.2 Action Roll Procedure

Most rolls are **action rolls**, used when a character attempts something risky.

**To make an action roll:**

1. **Choose a Trait**
   The GM and player agree which trait best applies, based on how the action is described. Some moves specify a particular trait (e.g., “Strength Roll (12)”).

2. **Set the Difficulty**

   * Some features list a fixed Difficulty.
   * Otherwise, the GM sets a Difficulty based on circumstances and may or may not say the number aloud, but should always state the stakes and possible consequences.

3. **Add Mods & Extra Dice**
   Before rolling, the acting player decides whether to:

   * Spend Hope to **Utilize an Experience** (spend 1 Hope to add one relevant Experience's modifier),
   * Use features that grant **advantage**, **Rally dice**, or other bonuses,
   * Spend Hope on class/domain features that modify the roll.
     All of these must be declared **before** rolling unless a feature specifically says it can be used afterward.

4. **Roll**

   * Roll your **Duality Dice** (Hope d12 and Fear d12).
   * Add:

     * Trait modifier,
     * Any Experience modifier (if paid for with Hope),
     * Advantage and Rally dice (if any).
   * Compute your **total**.

5. **Interpret the Result**
   Compare the total to the Difficulty and check which Duality Die is higher.

   * **Success with Hope** – Total ≥ Difficulty, and **Hope die > Fear die**
     You succeed and gain **1 Hope**.
   * **Success with Fear** – Total ≥ Difficulty, and **Fear die > Hope die**
     You succeed, but there is a cost, complication, or twist. The GM also gains **1 Fear**.
   * **Failure with Hope** – Total < Difficulty, and **Hope die > Fear die**
     You fail, but in a way that still offers a silver lining or minor benefit. You gain **1 Hope** and the spotlight usually shifts to the GM.
   * **Failure with Fear** – Total < Difficulty, and **Fear die > Hope die**
     You fail with a big consequence. The GM gains **1 Fear** and takes the spotlight.
   * **Critical Success** – The Hope and Fear dice show the **same number**
     You automatically succeed with an extra benefit, **gain 1 Hope**, and **clear 1 Stress**. If this was an attack roll, you deal **critical damage** (see §5.3). Crits are always treated as “rolled with Hope.”

After the outcome is resolved, the table cooperates to describe how the fiction changes.

### 4.3 Hope & Fear

**Hope** and **Fear** are shared meta‑currencies for dramatic swings in power.

#### 4.3.1 Hope (Players)

* PCs start with **2 Hope** and can hold up to **6** at once.
* Hope persists between sessions.
* You **gain Hope** mainly from:

  * Success with Hope,
  * Failure with Hope,
  * Some class/domain features and downtime options.

Players can **spend Hope** to:

1. **Help an Ally**

   * Describe how you assist.
   * Spend 1 Hope and roll a **d6 advantage die**.
   * The acting player adds the highest advantage die from all helpers to their roll.

2. **Utilize an Experience**

   * Spend **1 Hope**.
   * Choose one relevant Experience and **add its modifier** to your roll.

3. **Initiate a Tag Team Roll**

   * Spend **3 Hope** to combine your action with another PC's action (see §4.5).

4. **Activate Hope Features**

   * Many class/domain features list a cost in Hope (often 3) to trigger a powerful effect.
   * If you rolled with Hope, you may immediately spend the Hope gained from that roll on the feature.

#### 4.3.2 Fear (GM)

The GM holds a pool of **Fear tokens**.

* Start of campaign: Typically **1 Fear per PC** in the party.
* GM gains Fear when:

  * A PC's roll resolves **with Fear**,
  * The party rests (see Downtime),
  * Features or environments explicitly say so.

The GM can hold up to **12 Fear**, which carries over between sessions.

The GM can **spend Fear** to:

* Interrupt and seize the spotlight,
* Make an extra GM move,
* Activate an adversary or environment **Fear Feature**,
* Add an adversary's Experience to an attack or action roll, or otherwise intensify a scene. ([Daggerheart SRD][2])

### 4.4 Special Roll Types

#### 4.4.1 Trait Rolls

A rule that says “Agility Roll (13)” is a **trait roll**:

* It is an action roll using that specific trait at the listed Difficulty.
* Any feature that affects that trait applies here as well.
* Effects that modify “Agility rolls” also apply to **attacks**, **Spellcast rolls**, or other action rolls that use Agility.

#### 4.4.2 Spellcast Rolls

**Spellcast Rolls** are trait rolls that always use your **Spellcast trait**, which comes from your subclass. You only roll Spellcast when a card or feature says you do.

#### 4.4.3 Attack Rolls

An **attack roll** is an action roll whose goal is to inflict damage.

* Use the trait specified by the weapon or spell (e.g., Strength for a greatsword, Finesse for a rapier).
* Most attacks against PCs compare the roll total to the target's **Evasion**.
* Attacks against adversaries compare to the adversary's **Difficulty** value instead.

On a **hit**, you roll **damage** (see below) and then apply thresholds to see how many HP are marked (§2.5.1).

#### 4.4.4 Reaction Rolls

A **reaction roll** represents a character's attempt to dodge, endure, or mitigate an imminent effect (a falling boulder, a breath weapon, etc.).

* Follows the normal action roll procedure, but:

  * Reaction rolls **do not** generate Hope or Fear.
  * They do not trigger extra GM moves.
  * Other PCs cannot Help an Ally on your reaction roll (unless a feature explicitly says otherwise).
* A critical success on a reaction roll ignores the effect entirely but does **not** grant Hope or clear Stress.

#### 4.4.5 Group Action Rolls

When multiple PCs team up on one task:

* One PC is the **leader** and makes an action roll normally.
* Each assisting PC makes a **reaction roll** using whatever trait makes sense.
* For each **success**, the leader gets **+1** to their roll; for each **failure**, they suffer **−1**.

#### 4.4.6 Tag Team Rolls

Once per session per player, a PC may initiate a **Tag Team Roll** (cost: 3 Hope):

* Two PCs narrate how they combine their actions.
* Each rolls a full action roll separately.
* Before resolving, the players choose **one** of the two results and apply it to **both actions**.
* On a roll with Hope, **each** participating PC gains 1 Hope; on a roll with Fear, the GM gains 1 Fear per PC involved.
* On a successful Tag‑Team attack, both roll damage and **add totals together** as if from a single strike.

Tag Team Rolls count as **one action roll** for countdowns and similar tracking effects.

### 4.5 Advantage, Disadvantage, Rally Dice

#### 4.5.1 Advantage & Disadvantage

Some effects grant **advantage** or **disadvantage** on a roll:

* **Advantage:** Roll a **d6 advantage die** and add it to your total.
* **Disadvantage:** Roll a **d6 disadvantage die** and subtract it from your total.

Rules:

* Advantage and disadvantage dice cancel one‑for‑one if they would be added to the **same** dice pool (so you never roll them both for the same player at once).
* External sources of advantage/disadvantage (like another player's Help roll) can stack with your own.

#### 4.5.2 Rally Dice

Some classes (notably Bards) can grant **Rally Dice**:

* Typically once per session, a feature lets you hand out a **Rally die** (starting as a **d6**, upgraded to **d8** at higher levels).
* A PC can spend their Rally die to:

  * Add it to an action or reaction roll,
  * Boost a damage roll,
  * Or clear Stress equal to the die's value.

Unspent Rally dice usually clear at the end of the session unless a feature states otherwise.

---

## 5. Combat

Combat is not mechanically separate from the rest of play; it just emphasizes **positioning**, **damage**, and **threats** more heavily.

### 5.1 Ranges & Movement

Daggerheart uses abstract **range bands** which can be mapped to grids if desired.

* **Melee:** Touch range.
* **Very Close:** A few steps away.
* **Close:** Within a short sprint or quick move.
* **Far:** Bowshot distance.
* **Very Far:** Well beyond a single sprint; long‑range or sniping distance.

Basic movement:

* PCs can usually reposition **within Close range** as part of a move or attack.
* Moving farther (e.g., from Melee to Far, or across the battlefield under fire) may require an **Agility roll** or an action.

Line of sight and cover:

* You need **line of sight** to make most ranged attacks.
* Targets behind partial cover impose **disadvantage** on attacks against them.
* Total cover means the attack cannot be made.

### 5.2 Attacking

1. Narrate the attack and choose the target(s).
2. Determine which trait the attack uses (weapon, spell, or ability text).
3. Make an **attack roll** against the target's **Evasion** (for PCs) or **Difficulty** (for adversaries).
4. On success, roll damage and apply thresholds to mark HP.

Multi‑target attacks:

* If a spell or ability strikes multiple targets, you often:

  * Make **one attack roll**,
  * Make **one damage roll**, and
  * Compare the attack roll to each target individually; damage applies as appropriate.

### 5.3 Damage Types & Critical Damage

* There are two damage types:

  * **Physical (phy)**
  * **Magic (mag)**

Some creatures may have:

* **Resistance** – Halve incoming damage of that type before thresholds.
* **Immunity** – Ignore damage of that type entirely.
* **Direct Damage** – A special kind of damage that **cannot** be reduced by armor slots or similar effects.

**Critical Damage:** On a critical success attack (matching Duality Dice), you:

1. Roll damage as usual.
2. Add the **maximum possible value** of all the damage dice to the total.

   * Example: `2d8+1` becomes `2d8+1+16` on a crit.

### 5.4 Conditions

Some effects apply **Conditions**:

* **Hidden** – Enemies can't see you and don't know where you are; actions targeting you are rolled with disadvantage. You lose Hidden when you visibly emerge, attack, or are otherwise revealed.
* **Restrained** – You can't move but can still act from your space (unless further limited).
* **Vulnerable** – Any roll targeting you is rolled with advantage.

Other conditions may be special to certain features:

* **Temporary conditions** often include rules for how the affected creature can clear them—typically by using an action and succeeding at an appropriate roll.
* **Special conditions** specify unique requirements for removal (e.g., a particular ritual, item, or spell).

### 5.5 GM Combat Flow & Adversary Actions

The GM does not roll Duality Dice; instead, they use a **single d20 (the GM's Die)** for adversary attacks and rare adversary action rolls.

When an adversary attacks a PC:

1. Roll d20 + **Attack Modifier**.
2. If total ≥ target's **Evasion**, the attack hits.
3. Roll the damage dice listed in the adversary stat block; the PC marks HP accordingly.

On a natural 20:

* The adversary's attack automatically hits and deals **critical damage**: roll damage as normal and **add the maximum result** of the damage dice to the total.

When the **spotlight is on the GM**, they may:

* Spotlight an adversary to:

  * Move and attack,
  * Use a special action,
  * Clear a condition,
  * Sprint across the battlefield, or
  * Take any other fictionally appropriate move.
* Spend Fear to spotlight additional adversaries or use **Fear Features**.

---

## 6. Downtime, Rest, & Recovery

Between conflicts, the party can take **rests** to recover resources and advance personal projects.

### 6.1 Short Rest

A **short rest** is roughly an hour of in‑world downtime.

During a short rest:

1. Each PC may freely move domain cards between loadout and vault.
2. Each PC chooses **two downtime moves** (and may repeat the same move):

   Typical short‑rest moves include:

   * **Tend to Wounds** – Clear a small amount of HP (e.g., `1d4 + Tier`).
   * **Clear Stress** – Clear `1d4 + Tier` Stress.
   * **Repair Armor** – Clear `1d4 + Tier` Armor Slots on one set of armor.
   * **Prepare** – Describe how you get ready; gain 1 Hope, or 2 Hope if you prepare alongside one or more party members.

At the end of a short rest:

* Abilities that refresh **“per rest”** reset.
* Effects lasting **“until your next rest”** end.
* The GM gains **1d4 Fear** as a downtime consequence.

### 6.2 Long Rest

A **long rest** is several hours of sleep or deep relaxation (often overnight).

During a long rest:

1. Again, each PC can freely swap domain cards between vault and loadout.
2. Each PC chooses **two downtime moves** from the long‑rest list, such as:

   * **Tend to All Wounds** – Clear all HP for yourself or an ally.
   * **Clear All Stress**.
   * **Repair All Armor** – Clear all Armor Slots on one set of armor.
   * **Prepare** – As above (often granting Hope).
   * **Work on a Project** – Progress a long‑term project tied to a countdown (like crafting or research).

At the end of a long rest:

* Limited‑use abilities that refresh per rest or **per long rest** reset.
* Ongoing effects that last until your next (long) rest end.
* The GM gains **1d4 + number of PCs** Fear and can advance a long‑term countdown of their choice.

**Rest Rules:**

* If a party takes **three short rests in a row**, the next rest must be a **long rest**.
* If a rest is interrupted by danger, benefits can be reduced or lost (e.g., a long rest may only count as a short rest if you're attacked during it).

## 7. Death, Scars, & End of the Journey

When a PC marks their **last HP**, they fall and must choose a **death move**: ([Daggerheart SRD][3])

1. **Blaze of Glory**

   * Take one final action that automatically critically succeeds (with GM approval).
   * After this moment of heroism, your character dies.

2. **Avoid Death**

   * Your character collapses unconscious.
   * You and the GM describe how the situation worsens for the party.
   * You can't act, move, or be targeted by attacks until an ally clears at least 1 of your marked HP or the party finishes a long rest.
   * After each time you fall this way, roll your Hope die:

     * If the result is ≤ your level, you gain a **scar**:

       * Permanently cross out a Hope slot.
       * Work with the GM to define its lasting narrative impact and possible ways to heal it (if any).
     * If you ever cross out your **final Hope slot**, your journey ends.

3. **Risk It All**

   * Roll your Duality Dice:

     * If **Hope > Fear** – You stay standing and **clear HP and/or Stress equal to the Hope die** (split as you like).
     * If **Fear > Hope** – You die.
     * If **dice match** – You remain standing but clear **no** HP or Stress (note: the SRD's latest version clarifies that matching dice keep you up with no recovery; earlier text differs slightly—use the version your table prefers). ([Daggerheart SRD][3])

If a PC dies, you and the GM create a new character at the party's current level before the next session.

## 8. Leveling Up & Advancement

The GM decides when the party reaches a **narrative milestone** that warrants leveling up (roughly every 3 sessions). All PCs level up together.

There are **10 levels** divided into **4 tiers**:

* Tier 1: Level 1
* Tier 2: Levels 2–4
* Tier 3: Levels 5–7
* Tier 4: Levels 8–10

When you level up:

### 8.1 Step 1 – Tier Achievements

At specific levels you gain automatic benefits:

* **Level 2:**

  * New +2 Experience
  * +1 Proficiency
* **Level 5:**

  * New +2 Experience
  * +1 Proficiency
  * Clear “marked traits” so you can raise them again in later tiers
* **Level 8:**

  * New +2 Experience
  * +1 Proficiency
  * Clear marked traits

### 8.2 Step 2 – Advancements (2 choices)

Choose **two advancements** from your tier or lower (some options require both picks).

Examples of advancement types:

* Increase two unmarked Traits by +1 (and mark them so you can't raise them again until a later tier).
* Gain additional **HP slots** or **Stress slots** permanently.
* Increase one Experience by +1.
* Increase **Evasion** by +1.
* Take an additional **domain card** from your class's domains (or from your multiclass domain, if applicable).
* Gain an **upgraded subclass card** (specialization/mastery).
* Increase Proficiency (requires using both advancement choices).
* **Multiclass** (from level 5+; also uses both advancement choices).

### 8.3 Step 3 – Damage Thresholds

Increase all your **damage thresholds by 1** (Major and Severe).

### 8.4 Step 4 – Domain Cards

Choose a new domain card at or below your level from your class's domains and add it to your loadout or vault. You may also swap one previously acquired card for another of the same level.

### 8.5 Multiclassing

From **level 5** onward, you can choose to **multiclass** as an advancement:

* Pick a second class.
* Gain its **class feature** and access to **one of its domains**.
* Add its multiclass module to your character sheet.
* Take a **foundation card** from one of that class's subclasses.
* When gaining new domain cards, you may instead choose from the multiclass domain, up to **half your level (rounded up)**.

Taking multiclass normally replaces some other advancement options, as described in the SRD.

## 9. GM Guidance & Tools

This section summarizes the GM‑side rules and tools.

### 9.1 GM Principles & Practices

The SRD gives GMs a suite of principles, such as:

* Be curious about players' ideas.
* Keep the story moving (every roll should change the situation).
* Cut to the action when scenes drag.
* Help players use the game's mechanics.
* Ground NPC actions in their motives.
* Spend Fear generously; players will generate more.

And pitfalls to avoid, like undermining the PCs, over‑planning, or hoarding Fear.

### 9.2 GM Moves

The GM makes **moves** when:

* A player rolls with Fear.
* A player fails an action roll.
* A character's actions invite consequences.
* Players look to the GM for what happens next.

GM moves can include:

* Show signs of an approaching threat.
* Reveal unwelcome truths.
* Separate PCs.
* Deal damage or mark Stress.
* Introduce new adversaries, hazards, or countdowns.
* Spend Fear to trigger powerful adversary or environment features.

### 9.3 Countdowns

**Countdowns** track looming events, such as a ritual completing or reinforcements arriving.

* A countdown has a starting value (e.g., 3, 5, or 10).
* When it **advances**, the value is reduced by 1.
* When it reaches **0**, its effect occurs (a portal opens, a building collapses, etc.).

Types:

* **Standard countdowns:** Tick down once every time a player makes an action roll.
* **Dynamic countdowns:** Advancement depends on roll outcomes:

  * Success with Hope → progress countdowns might tick down more,
  * Failures with Fear → consequence countdowns may drop faster, etc. (the SRD includes a full advancement table).
* **Looping**, **increasing**, **decreasing**, **linked**, and **long‑term** countdowns offer more complex pacing tools.

### 9.4 Encounter Building

The SRD offers a **Battle Points** guideline:

* Start with approximately **(3 × number of PCs) + 2** Battle Points.
* Adjust up or down depending on desired difficulty, adversary tiers, and whether you include major threats such as Leaders or Solos.
* Spend Battle Points to “buy” adversaries of different roles (Minions, Standard, Bruisers, Ranged, Skulks, Leaders, Solos, etc.). ([Daggerheart SRD][2])

This produces fast, deadly battles with room for GM improvisation.

## 10. Optional & Advanced Rules

A few additional tools from the SRD you can include as needed:

* **Fate Rolls:** For outcomes entirely left to chance (“Do the reinforcements arrive in time?”), the GM can ask a player to roll one Duality die and interpret the result against a simple scale.
* **GM‑run Allies:** Important friendly NPCs can be run with simple features and narrative positioning rather than full stat blocks.
* **Loot Tables & Magic Items:** The SRD includes rollable tables for magical trinkets and unusual gear; the GM can freely re‑skin or replace them for tone.
* **Companions:** Some classes (e.g., Ranger) can have animal or spirit companions with their own Stress, Experiences, and attacks.

## 11. Using This Ruleset

You can treat this markdown ruleset as:

* A **reference** for players learning how Daggerheart works.
* A **foundation** for house‑rules and homebrew content.
* An overview to complement the full Daggerheart SRD, which includes all card text, example adversaries, domain references, and the official legal language for publishing compatible content. ([Daggerheart][1])
